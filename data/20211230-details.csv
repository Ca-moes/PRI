B07114LRBB,"Meet the Galaxy S8 - Infinitely Brilliant. The Galaxy S8 has the world's first Infinity Screen, A screen without limits. The expansive display stretches from edge to edge, giving you the most amount of screen in the least amount of space. The revolutionary design of the Galaxy S8 begins from the inside out. We rethought every part of the phone's layout to break through the confines of the smartphone screen. So all you see is pure content and no bezel. It's the biggest, most immersive screen on a Galaxy smartphone of this size. And it's easy to hold in one hand. The Infinity Display has an incredible end-to-end screen that spills over the phone's sides, forming a completely smooth, continuous surface with no bumps or angles. It's pure, pristine, uninterrupted glass. And it takes up the entire front of the phone, flowing seamlessly into the aluminum shell. The result is a beautifully curved, perfectly symmetrical, singular object. Capture life as it happens with the Galaxy S8 cameras. The 12MP rear camera and the 8MP front camera are so accurate and fast that you won't miss a moment, day or night. Prying eyes are not a problem when you have iris scanning on the Galaxy S8. No two irises have the same pattern, not even yours, and they're nearly impossible to replicate. That means with iris scanning, your phone and its contents open to your eyes only. And when you need to unlock really fast, face recognition is a handy option. You never really stop using your phone. That's why Galaxy S8 is driven by the world's first 10nm processor. It's fast and powerful and increases battery efficiency. Plus, there's the ability to expand storage, and to work through rain and dust with IP68-rated performance.","['5.8-inch Super AMOLED Capacitive Touchscreen, 1440 x 2960 pixel resolution with Scratch Resistant Display & Corning Gorilla Glass 5', 'Android OS', 'Internal Memory: 64GB, 4GB RAM - microSD Up to 256GB', '12MP Camera with Sensor Model: Sony IMX260 Exmor RS, f/1.7, Dual LED & 8MP Front Camera with Sensor Type: ISOCELL, f/1.7, 1.22 (pixel size), 1/3.6 inch Sensor Size', 'WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/n(5GHz)/ac; Bluetooth: v5.0, A2DP, aptX; GPS: Yes with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS; USB: 3.1, USB Type-C Reversible Connector']","['Model Name: Galaxy S8', 'Wireless Carrier: AT&T', 'Brand: Samsung Electronics', 'Form Factor: Smartphone', 'Memory Storage Capacity: 64 GB', 'Operating System: Android 7.0', 'Color: Artic Silver', 'Cellular Technology: 2G', 'Screen Size: 5.8 Inches', 'Display Type: AMOLED']"

We rethought every part of the phone's layout to break through the confines of the smartphone screen. So all you see is pure content and no bezel. It's the biggest, most immersive screen on a Galaxy smartphone of this size. And it's easy to hold in one hand. The Infinity Display has an incredible end-to-end screen that spills over the phone’s sides, forming a completely smooth, continuous surface with no bumps or angles. It’s pure, pristine, uninterrupted glass. And it takes up the entire front of the phone, flowing seamlessly into the aluminum shell.

The Infinity Display has an incredible end-to-end screen that spills over the phone's sides, forming a completely smooth, continuous surface with no bumps or angles. It's pure, pristine, uninterrupted glass. And it takes up the entire front of the phone, flowing seamlessly into the aluminum shell.

If you are not able to connect to your network after finalizing the product setup, please contact your carrier support for additional assistance as every carrier has different steps to assist you in ensuring your product connects to their compatible network. How can I ensure other people hear me on my microphone? If you are experiencing microphone issues with your device and your product has a Google Assistant button, please ensure that the Google Assistant button is not stuck or dirty as this will cause the microphone to not function as intended. If the Google Assistant button is not obstructed, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If the headphone port is also clear, please disable the microphone permission of the Google Assistant, by going to Settings > Apps & Notifications > Google App > Permission > Microphone > Deny.

Why is my phone feeling warm, closing apps or occasionally slowing down? During extended operation, the device may feel warm. In most cases, this is normal.

Your phone should then restart momentarily. This is a safe and quick way to reboot your device without losing or erasing any data. My phone won’t charge. What should I do? First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should. Then, try turning your phone off completely and plugging it into the socket - bear in mind if the battery is completely drained, it might take up to 2 or 3 minutes to start charging. How can I contact support? Our customer support page offers a number of ways that you can contact support. Please visit the Nokia website for further assistance. How do I fix touch sensitivity issues on my phone?

Please note: a hard reset will completely erase all the data, settings and content on your smartphone, returning it to the original factory settings. We strongly advise that you back up your device before a hard reset. Visit here to learn more about how to back up your smartphone remotely. To reset your smartphone and erase all its content, first make sure your phone is connected to a power source. We also recommend that your battery is at least 50% charged when you perform a hard reset.

Then choose the action you want to take from the root menu, in this case “Wipe data/factory reset”. Alternatively, you can also perform a hard reset by tapping Settings > Backup & Reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone > Erase everything.","['Get up to 70% better performance compared to previous generations, thanks to the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 mobile platform.', 'Enjoy all your favorite entertainment in 6.39-inch immersive HD+ with punch hole display for maximized screen real estate.', 'Charge less and get up to two days on a single charge with the Adaptive Battery.

Then find the app you're having issues with and select Force Stop. I want to conserve battery life. How can I activate the Power Saver mode? On your phone, open Settings, then choose and activate Battery Power Saving. Please also be aware that battery life depends on a variety of factors such as device usage frequency, application requirements, your current operating system, and cellular signal strength. How can I back up my files? Navigate to Settings > System > Backup, and switch backup on. How can I reset my smartphone's network settings? Navigate to Settings > Network & Internet > more_vert > Reset. Performing this reset may help if you're having connection issues. How do I connect my phone to my carrier network? If your Nokia phone and network are compatible, place your SIM card in the SIM card tray using the included SIM card removal tool to open the SIM tray. Once your SIM card has been inserted into the device, power on your phone and proceed through the product setup steps. If you are not able to connect to your network after finalizing the product setup, please contact your carrier support for additional assistance as every carrier has different steps to assist you in ensuring your product connects to their compatible network. How can I ensure other people hear me on my microphone? If you are experiencing microphone issues with your device and your product has a Google Assistant button, please ensure that the Google Assistant button is not stuck or dirty as this will cause the microphone to not function as intended. If the Google Assistant button is not obstructed, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If the headphone port is also clear, please disable the microphone permission of the Google Assistant, by going to Settings > Apps & Notifications > Google App > Permission > Microphone > Deny. How can I turn up the volume to my speaker? First, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If your headphone port is clear, please make sure that “Do Not Disturb” is not enabled. To disable this setting, navigate to Settings > Do not disturb. Make sure this is toggled off. If Do Not Disturb is off, navigate to Settings > Sounds and vibration > Volume > move the Media slider to the right to increase volume and test your speaker. If you are still not able to hear any audio, check the settings of the application that you are using from the Settings menu as many applications will have their own volume settings. Why is my phone feeling warm, closing apps or occasionally slowing down? During extended operation, the device may feel warm. In most cases, this is normal. To avoid getting too warm, the device may automatically slow down, dim display during a video call, close apps, switch off charging, and if necessary, switch itself off. If the device is not working properly, take it to the nearest authorized service facility. How do I reboot my smartphone when it’s not responding? If your phone is unresponsive, you can perform a “soft reset” by pressing the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 15 seconds (or until phone vibrates). Your phone should then restart momentarily. This is a safe and quick way to reboot your device without losing or erasing any data. My phone won’t charge. What should I do? First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should. Then, try turning your phone off completely and plugging it into the socket - bear in mind if the battery is completely drained, it might take up to 2 or 3 minutes to start charging. How can I contact support? Our customer support page offers a number of ways that you can contact support. Please visit the Nokia website for further assistance. How do I fix touch sensitivity issues on my phone? Before performing any additional troubleshooting steps, please ensure that your product does not show any physical damage, has not been exposed to water, the screen is clean, and your fingers and hands are not wet or dirty. Please also remove any 3rd party screen protectors that you may have on the device as non Nokia branded screen protectors may decrease the touch sensitivity of the device. If none of these solutions resolve the issue that you are facing, please perform a hard reset back to factory settings. Please note: a hard reset will completely erase all the data, settings and content on your smartphone, returning it to the original factory settings. We strongly advise that you back up your device before a hard reset. Visit here to learn more about how to back up your smartphone remotely. To reset your smartphone and erase all its content, first make sure your phone is connected to a power source. We also recommend that your battery is at least 50% charged when you perform a hard reset. Press the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 30 seconds or until the root menu appears. Then choose the action you want to take from the root menu, in this case “Wipe data/factory reset”. Alternatively, you can also perform a hard reset by tapping Settings > Backup & Reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone > Erase everything.","['Discover a world of perks that come with 4G, including clearer call quality, seamless sharing, and multiplayer gaming.', 'Get more out of your phone with long-lasting battery life and signature sturdiness.

How can I ensure other people hear me on my microphone? If you are experiencing microphone issues with your device and your product has a Google Assistant button, please ensure that the Google Assistant button is not stuck or dirty as this will cause the microphone to not function as intended. If the Google Assistant button is not obstructed, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If the headphone port is also clear, please disable the microphone permission of the Google Assistant, by going to Settings > Apps & Notifications > Google App > Permission > Microphone > Deny.

Why is my phone feeling warm, closing apps or occasionally slowing down? During extended operation, the device may feel warm. In most cases, this is normal. To avoid getting too warm, the device may automatically slow down, dim display during a video call, close apps, switch off charging, and if necessary, switch itself off.

If your phone is unresponsive, you can perform a “soft reset” by pressing the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 15 seconds (or until phone vibrates). Your phone should then restart momentarily. This is a safe and quick way to reboot your device without losing or erasing any data. My phone won’t charge. What should I do? First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should. Then, try turning your phone off completely and plugging it into the socket - bear in mind if the battery is completely drained, it might take up to 2 or 3 minutes to start charging. How can I contact support? Our customer support page offers a number of ways that you can contact support. Please visit the Nokia website for further assistance. How do I fix touch sensitivity issues on my phone? Before performing any additional troubleshooting steps, please ensure that your product does not show any physical damage, has not been exposed to water, the screen is clean, and your fingers and hands are not wet or dirty. Please also remove any 3rd party screen protectors that you may have on the device as non Nokia branded screen protectors may decrease the touch sensitivity of the device. If none of these solutions resolve the issue that you are facing, please perform a hard reset back to factory settings. Please note: a hard reset will completely erase all the data, settings and content on your smartphone, returning it to the original factory settings. We strongly advise that you back up your device before a hard reset. Visit here to learn more about how to back up your smartphone remotely. To reset your smartphone and erase all its content, first make sure your phone is connected to a power source. We also recommend that your battery is at least 50% charged when you perform a hard reset. Press the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 30 seconds or until the root menu appears. Then choose the action you want to take from the root menu, in this case “Wipe data/factory reset”. Alternatively, you can also perform a hard reset by tapping Settings > Backup & Reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone > Erase everything.","['Android smartphone features an amazing quad camera (64MP + 8MP Ultra-Wide + 2MP Macro + 2MP Depth) with ZEISS cinematic effects\u200b', 'High performance, long lasting 4500mAh battery with 8GB RAM, 128GB internal storage, and expandable memory\u200b', 'The Nokia 8.3 is the only 5G smartphone supporting all 5G bands through the Snapdragon 765G modular platform \u200b', 'This Android 5G smartphone lets you choose or change carriers and data plans; compatible with T-Mobile, Cricket, Tracfone, Simple Mobile, and AT&T (AT&T 4G only, AT&T 5G not supported).']","['Model Name: 8.3 5G', 'Wireless Carrier: Unlocked', 'Brand: Nokia', 'Form Factor: Bar', 'Memory Storage Capacity: 128 GB', 'Operating System: Android 10.0', 'Color: Blue', 'Cellular Technology: 5G, 4G LTE', 'SIM card slot count: Dual SIM', 'Year: 2020']"

First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should.

Then find the app you're having issues with and select Force Stop. I want to conserve battery life. How can I activate the Power Saver mode? On your phone, open Settings, then choose and activate Battery Power Saving. Please also be aware that battery life depends on a variety of factors such as device usage frequency, application requirements, your current operating system, and cellular signal strength. How can I back up my files? Navigate to Settings > System > Backup, and switch backup on. How can I reset my smartphone's network settings? Navigate to Settings > Network & Internet > more_vert > Reset. Performing this reset may help if you're having connection issues. How do I connect my phone to my carrier network? If your Nokia phone and network are compatible, place your SIM card in the SIM card tray using the included SIM card removal tool to open the SIM tray. Once your SIM card has been inserted into the device, power on your phone and proceed through the product setup steps. If you are not able to connect to your network after finalizing the product setup, please contact your carrier support for additional assistance as every carrier has different steps to assist you in ensuring your product connects to their compatible network. How can I ensure other people hear me on my microphone? If you are experiencing microphone issues with your device and your product has a Google Assistant button, please ensure that the Google Assistant button is not stuck or dirty as this will cause the microphone to not function as intended. If the Google Assistant button is not obstructed, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If the headphone port is also clear, please disable the microphone permission of the Google Assistant, by going to Settings > Apps & Notifications > Google App > Permission > Microphone > Deny. How can I turn up the volume to my speaker? First, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If your headphone port is clear, please make sure that “Do Not Disturb” is not enabled. To disable this setting, navigate to Settings > Do not disturb. Make sure this is toggled off. If Do Not Disturb is off, navigate to Settings > Sounds and vibration > Volume > move the Media slider to the right to increase volume and test your speaker. If you are still not able to hear any audio, check the settings of the application that you are using from the Settings menu as many applications will have their own volume settings. Why is my phone feeling warm, closing apps or occasionally slowing down? During extended operation, the device may feel warm. In most cases, this is normal. To avoid getting too warm, the device may automatically slow down, dim display during a video call, close apps, switch off charging, and if necessary, switch itself off. If the device is not working properly, take it to the nearest authorized service facility. How do I reboot my smartphone when it’s not responding? If your phone is unresponsive, you can perform a “soft reset” by pressing the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 15 seconds (or until phone vibrates). Your phone should then restart momentarily. This is a safe and quick way to reboot your device without losing or erasing any data. My phone won’t charge. What should I do? First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should. Then, try turning your phone off completely and plugging it into the socket - bear in mind if the battery is completely drained, it might take up to 2 or 3 minutes to start charging. How can I contact support? Our customer support page offers a number of ways that you can contact support. Please visit the Nokia website for further assistance. How do I fix touch sensitivity issues on my phone? Before performing any additional troubleshooting steps, please ensure that your product does not show any physical damage, has not been exposed to water, the screen is clean, and your fingers and hands are not wet or dirty. Please also remove any 3rd party screen protectors that you may have on the device as non Nokia branded screen protectors may decrease the touch sensitivity of the device. If none of these solutions resolve the issue that you are facing, please perform a hard reset back to factory settings. Please note: a hard reset will completely erase all the data, settings and content on your smartphone, returning it to the original factory settings. We strongly advise that you back up your device before a hard reset. Visit here to learn more about how to back up your smartphone remotely. To reset your smartphone and erase all its content, first make sure your phone is connected to a power source. We also recommend that your battery is at least 50% charged when you perform a hard reset. Press the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 30 seconds or until the root menu appears. Then choose the action you want to take from the root menu, in this case “Wipe data/factory reset”. Alternatively, you can also perform a hard reset by tapping Settings > Backup & Reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone > Erase everything.","['Latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G Mobile Platform', '48MP camera setup with AI and video selfie stabilization', 'Android 11', '3 years of monthly security updates and 2 years of OS upgrades', 'This Android 5G smartphone lets you choose or change carriers and data plans; compatible with GSM carriers including T-Mobile, Cricket, and AT&T (AT&T 4G only, AT&T 5G not supported)']","['Model Name: Nokia G50', 'Wireless Carrier: Unlocked', 'Brand: Nokia', 'Form Factor: Bar', 'Memory Storage Capacity: 128 GB', 'Operating System: Android 11.0', 'Color: Ocean Blue', 'Cellular Technology: 5G, 4G LTE', 'SIM card slot count: Single SIM', 'Year: 2021']"
