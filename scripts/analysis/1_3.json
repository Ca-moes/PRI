Switched from S8+ and it's definitely a step up, although the UI is just different enough to take some getting used to. Camera is great. Most Importantly: it works with AT&T plug and play, removed SIM from old phone and or into Pixel 3xl and it picked right up. No issues! Call/text/mms functioning No Verizon icon on boot screen All apps work System updates no problem Phone was last fully charged 104 days ago Has minor scratch on screen and in corners, annoying, but worth not paying full price for", "helpfulVotes": 14, "country": "United States", "id": "B07HKPMFZ5-r17", "content_type": "review", "_version_": 1722139936893698048, "asin": "B07HKPMFZ5"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating_review": 5, "date": "2017-11-07T00:00:00Z", "verified": true, "title_review": "Great Seller, Great Phone", "body": "I was very hesitant about purchasing a refurbished phone because you never know what you're going to get.

My time for a upgrade through AT&T was up so I looked on the At&T store online but at the time they didn't have the galaxy3 in stock so I checked on amazon and sure enough they had it and was cheaper than the store! The phone arrived quickly no problems setting it up. I Love the size and quality of the phone! I need a bigger screen and this is it! Easy to navigate through and it has video help through the phone to help with whatever you need. Bright and so many features i'm completely happy with it. Easy to hold and talk on it. Battery life isn't the greatest but it's not too bad I mean it is a smart phone and with apps it does tend to drain some of the battery but that doesn't bug me at all.Great phone!", "helpfulVotes": 10, "country": "United States", "id": "B00891PTQM-r4", "content_type": "review", "_version_": 1722139936575979520, "asin": "B00891PTQM"}, {"name": "REBECCA", "rating_review": 5, "date": "2021-07-16T00:00:00Z", "verified": true, "title_review": "Great purchase!", "body": "Packing was nice, phone looks brand new works great so far.

The difference in speed between this phone and my iPhone SE is barely noticeable. The Nokia only comes with 8GB of memory, before I put any apps on it I noticed it had about 4.3GB of space left. I added a micro SD card even though I only put a couple of apps in the phone. It takes better looking pictures than my iPhone SE. The battery does last days on Standby, I would say about 4 days. Due to the low price it doesn't have some upscale features such as a metal back or the latest battery charging connector, still at $99 you are getting a lot of bang for your buck. I'm tempted to get a Nokia phone as a replacement for my iPhone but I really do prefer iOS over Android. Too bad you can't get iOS on Nokia.", "helpfulVotes": 36, "country": "United States", "id": "B075FLG6MV-r1", "content_type": "review", "_version_": 1722139937540669440, "asin": "B075FLG6MV"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating_review": 5, "date": "2018-03-13T00:00:00Z", "verified": true, "title_review": "Great phone, lots of memory.", "body": "Great phone.

I use quotes because to be flat out honest, this is pretty much everything most people need in a phone. Yes, there are some folks out there who need to have the latest and greatest devices, but this one probably takes care of most 80% of smartphone users out there. The finish and backing on the phone are made out of great materials. The backing is a slight rubberized material and doesn't slide off tables or in your hand. My friend has a Motorola Nexus 6 phone which is several hundreds more than this one, and the phone is pretty similar in build and finish. The Verizon model of this phone, in particular, is great because there are some simple workarounds for those who are computer/tech savvy to get the GSM slot of this phone unlocked for use on ATT and T-Mobile. Do a quick google search on \"Moto E Verizon GSM unlock\" and that should get you started. I struggled with it a little bit, but after about 30 minutes I was able to get it unlocked and used it with Cricket Wireless. 4G LTE data was occasionally inconsistent, however. Overall a great device with screen size and form similar to that of an iPhone 5. One frustrating thing about later versions of Android is the inability for apps to read/write on to your SD card (since Kitkat, I believe). I frequently listen to podcasts using the BeyondPod app, which downloads MP3s directly to the phone now, instead of on my SD card, because of the limitations on the Android OS. Still a great phone at a tremendous value, if you can get these during occasional sales at around $40.", "helpfulVotes": 11, "country": "United States", "id": "B00SIE2YQ8-r1", "content_type": "review", "_version_": 1722139936746897408, "asin": "B00SIE2YQ8"}, {"name": "Chris", "rating_review": 5, "date": "2017-11-02T00:00:00Z", "verified": true, "title_review": "Good Stuff / Some information for the seller", "body": "I love this phone let me be clear it uses a micro sim card not a nano sim card. i owned the original Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Express Prime. you guys need to get your description and answered question right because there are some things wrong.

At first I did not think I would be able to get used to a new phone. I had been using my Galaxy 5 forever and it was in pretty rough shape. Still I really liked it. I decided it was time to up grade. I read the reviews of the seller. Good reviews. The phone is sleek and smooth. The 8 plus is a bit larger than what I am used to. However I like the extra length. The camera is amazing and has some pretty cool features. Slow motion is awesome for video. There are some features, like Bixby that are pre installed on the phone and also Samsung web. When opening gmail there is only the option to open the links up on Samsung web. I am sure this can be changed, but tricky. I do not care for either feature and would rather choose my settings. When you swipe all the way to the left, this Bixby is on your phone. Apparently it is a point system by Samsung. It seems to be ending though, so possibly it will be uninstalled. Over all great phone especially refurbished. Will note that mine did not come with the original charger. This seems to be an isolated case, as most people said theirs did. I have a Samsung dock, and the type c charger will still fit. Good phone very happy.
