One thing I will say, I love the color. It was described as Orchid gray, but the color I received is actually silver, and that is the color I originally wanted. One more thing, I was surprised at how quick the phone arrived after I placed my order. I guess that's because the seller is in Kentucky and I live in North Carolina.", "helpfulVotes": 0, "country": "United States", "id": "B075ZD2WFN-r2", "content_type": "review", "_version_": 1722139917113360384, "asin": "B075ZD2WFN"}]
