I switched to the S series under recommendation from a friend and have been using it a few months now after receiving one as a gift. Here are my thoughts Pros: -Hands down, this model cant be beat in storage. If you are like me and like to have several different apps for freelance purposes (along with a million pictures of your kids), this phone is your best friend. -The camera has a lot more features and clarity than the J series and less blur to the photos. -The enhanced maintqience features really help keep this phone in tip top shape, especially If used regularly. -Pretty decent battery life. I can run Pokekon GO along with several other apps for alseveral hours without my battery dying or overheating. -The screen is pretty dang resilient. I've not yet been able to find a screen protector that works for me and have dropped this several times and have yet to crack the screen. -Considering what you are getting out if this phone, the price is really pretty good. Cons: - the slight curve to the screen makes finding a screen protector incredibly difficult. I have gone through several that never stuck for more than 24 hours. -i find that the interface is just slightly less user friendly than previous editions, but it may be more of a personal preference. -there is no manual home button, just a touch screen button, which can take some adjusting to. Overall, so far this is the best phone I've had. I give it 4 stars simply because the curve of the phone has made it nearly impossible to find a screen protector, which I feel is essential when using your phone as I do for business.", "helpfulVotes": 1, "country": "United States", "id": "B076M9RQJ2-r366", "content_type": "review", "_version_": 1722131200173146112, "asin": "B076M9RQJ2"}, {"name": "Ben Pham", "rating_review": 1, "date": "2020-11-18T00:00:00Z", "verified": true, "title_review": "Terrible Battery Life and touch screen", "body": "Bought this renewal product as a gift. It came in 2 days (Nov 16 to Nov 18) but item is not as the description. It was advertised as battery exceed 80% (This product will have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new) but it was exactly at 80% which means I have to replace a new battery eventually which costs another $80-$100. The screen freezes off a lot of time and one one point, only the home button works. I have to do hard reset to make it coming back to usual. Trying to call customer services but no one available, emailing them is no help. I regret to buy this. Now I have to take time to return plus I need to find a different one in 2 days.

I was originally looking at a Samsung and someone posted in a review this phone as a recommendation. After looking at reviews and watching videos, I decided to take a shot on it. I'm glad I did! So far it works perfectly. I'm on Cricket in the US and have had no problems. I simply removed my sim card from my old phone and put it in my new phone and it worked just fine. I was able to sync everything from my google account and was good to go!

One thing I will say, I love the color. It was described as Orchid gray, but the color I received is actually silver, and that is the color I originally wanted. One more thing, I was surprised at how quick the phone arrived after I placed my order.
