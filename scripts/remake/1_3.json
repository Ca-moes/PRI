    "body": "Only had 1 day but initial impressions are great. Have AT&T, no issues connecting or with calls/texts or updates. Switched from S8+ and it's definitely a step up, although the UI is just different enough to take some getting used to. Camera is great. Most Importantly: it works with AT&T plug and play, removed SIM from old phone and or into Pixel 3xl and it picked right up. No issues! Call/text/mms functioning No Verizon icon on boot screen All apps work System updates no problem Phone was last fully charged 104 days ago Has minor scratch on screen and in corners, annoying, but worth not paying full price for",

    "body": "Pretty happy with my purchase. I broke my S7 Edge and wanted another one. Verizon has new ones for around 750, but 350 refurbished is a great deal. Very very little wear around the home button and that's it. Connected to Verizon through my already existing sim card. Works great so far.",

I had never purchased an unlocked phone prior to this one and I was more than a little nervous. The phone arrived and was in excellent condition. It looked brand new. But, more importantly, it worked great! My husband travels across the country and his phone must work well. I would definitely buy another one.",
