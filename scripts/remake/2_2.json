One thing I will say, I love the color. It was described as Orchid gray, but the color I received is actually silver, and that is the color I originally wanted. One more thing, I was surprised at how quick the phone arrived after I placed my order. I guess that's because the seller is in Kentucky and I live in North Carolina.",
