            "title_review": "Decent Smart Phone (Review based on Sprint Network)",
            "body": "I've had this phone for a little over a month and have been pleased with it thus far. It has Windows Mobile 6.1 on it which has a few updates from version 6.0 such as frequently used programs on the start menu, and threaded text messages. The threaded text messages come in handy when determining context of a message. The keyboard allows for typing primarily with the thumbs and can take a bit of getting used to the tiny size but you get the hang of it after a while. Another drawback of the small keyboard size is the necessity to use the Fn key to enter numbers or special characters. A USB cable comes with the phone and is useful when transferring files between a computer and the phone. Using the ative sync capabilities to link Outlook email with the phone is very useful in staying in touch with people while on the go. When taking a picture or video with the phone, you can immediately send it to an email address via Outlook. For those who use Microsoft Communicator Instant Messenger, it is also possible to load the IM program on the phone and communicate with people via IM. The phone additionally has GPS capabilities and if you download Google Maps, is very useful for obtaining directions when out and about. By adding a memory card, you can boost the storage capabilities and might choose to load music, pictures, or video files if using this option. You can use the mobile internet platform and it works decently well for obtaining basic news, weather, or email from applications such as Gmail. It is not as robust or smooth as using a device such as an iPhone but gets the job done. I recommend disabling the loading of pictures to help with download speed. If you sign up for an unlimited data service plan, you may also consider using the internet sharing functionality. This provides the ability to use your phone as a modem for your computer via USB cable, which is valuable for those who travel frequently or move from place to place with a laptop and still need internet access. The speed on the Sprint network has been comparable to wireless access in a hotel room.",

            "body": "Be warned: on any of their Pda/Smartphone type device, Verizon has no GetitNow, no Mobile Web, and many apps available for regular phones are off limits. On my previous Verizon phone, I could get a 24-hour sub to VZ Navigator when I needed it (which amounted to roughly 4 times in a year). Having the GPS for $3 when I needed it was awesome. When you upgrade to a PDA, Verizon does not tell you that the only way to get the VZ Navigator working is the monthly sub. And you'd have to call customer support, and have it added. GPS on this device is locked to VZ Navigator. It actually makes more sense getting a GPS Bluetooth receiver, like Garmin 10. Why did I switch to it and why did I not get a phone like the Voyager? Because Contact list where all you have are 5 phones and 2 emails is a joke. I want to store addresses, birthdays, IM ids, and whatever other info there is. In the contacts department, Moto Q9c delivers in spades. Overall impression: I like the device, it is very slim and light, all the buttons have a nice tactile feel, and navigation is easy after a little getting used to, lots of customization options. The default screen setup is quirky, but you can load 3rd party software - especially once you application unlock. Add a spacious miniSD card(2GB can be had for less than $10), and you can store apps, ringtones, music etc there. 2GB cards cost less than $10 these days. ActiveSync makes PC communication a snap. Email was setup in 5 minutes. For internet, you are better off using mobile versions of sites (like m.ebay.com) While Verizon does put in roadblocks, the coverage, signal, call quality, and data speed are all great. If someone cracks the internal GPS so you can use Google Maps with it, the way you can on the Sprint version, that would be perfect.",

            "body": "This is my second Q. The main reason I upgraded was because after checking it out at a Verizon store, the salesperson showed me HIS Q9C and how it worked with Google Maps and Windows Live Maps. After using it for a couple of weeks and researching this to death, they lock the GPS functionality unless you subscribe to Verizon Navigator for an extra $10 per month. Not what I saw with my own eyes and not what I understood when I bought it. The GPS functionality of the phone should work with whatever application I can run on the phone. Without that functionality it is of no more value than the original Q. The new Windows Mobile 6.x OS adds nothing.",

Earlier review: I still like my Palm 750P best, but this is the closest I could find, Pros: it has a hardware & on screen keyboard; has a fully configurable wi-fi hotspot; it allows you to block most automatic online activity to save both battery & data charges, Cons: no simple means of syncing with my desktop like my Palm; the built-in notepad SUCKS with no \"Memo\" feature like Palm; cutting & pasting is not as intuitive as on the Palm, in fact it's a pain in the ass.",

It's function is only saved by Android which offers enough shortcuts while typing to get by. The SIM port does work well when traveling overseas, the WiFi works OK too, battery life is pitiful if you actually use the phone. I can't believe this is Motorola's effort at a \"Pro\" phone.

As far as Droid Pros themselves, I liked mine for the most part while I had it. But I went through three of them, and each of them had charging port issues. My friend has also had two Droid Pros that the charging port became loose in and stopped working. I have an iPhone now, but as far as Droids go, I really liked this one.",

            "body": "I have recently made the change from a HTC One M7 to a Droid Pro. I did this because I wear my device on my belt everyday and wanted to ditch the bulk. If you keep your expectations in check, this device works! The Droid Pro is from 2010, which is a relic by today's standards. It operating system is Android 2.3.3, which is obviously out of date, but all the basics are there. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to kill tasks and close apps as they are opened. Other than downloading an app from the Play store, there is no way to do this. Bluetooth works great with my Ford Sync system. It keeps connection to it better than previous phones that I had owned. Wi-Fi, Vibration alerts and call quality have been great! Battery life has been good as well. The key for this phone is, the more modern apps you put on this phone, the more bogged down it will be. Facebook, Messenger and Linkedin made this phone slow down big time. Ebay is the only \"social media\" app that I installed. That application runs smoothly and works perfect. Basic weather widgets, Mr. Number and email sync work great. Internet is fine but you wouldn't want to do much surfing on such a small screen. Battery life has not been an issue at all. I get emails all day long, use the vibration alerts, keep Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on all day, battery at the end of day is 75% charged. I do have it in \"Maximum Battery Saver\" which seems to help. So the biggest plus is the size and the Otterbox (and other cases) that can be bought. With such a small screen, this phone is easy to carry on my belt. I use my old HTC One M7 at home for surfing and social media. Since social media it is not installed on my Droid Pro, I won't get alerts that I don't want or be tempted to check it during the day. It is nice to step away from it when you are out. For the right person, this is a good phone. Keep the expectations in check and you will enjoy using the Droid Pro.",

The much newer Nokia Lumia 1520 also, has the Windows 8.1 operating system but it is on the list of Lumina phones that canbe upgraded to the Windows 10 operating system. Which I did with did without any problems. The 6\" screen quality is gorgeous. Takes beautiful pictures, no issues getting online. Sound is much better than my old 520. The 1520 with the Win10 OS, supports Dolby with 5.1 headphones has an equalizer. The dial pad is easy to use as it has a much bigger. There a a ton of available apps. Some are truly free others you have to shell out some money. So far, I have not any issues switching between apps. The 1520 meets all of my needs. Why didn't I buy this device before? As with all of my reviews I will update this one in about 6 months, or earlier if problems occur.",

            "body": "Upgrading from my older, very reliable and functional Nokia 900 Windows Phone to my new Nokia 1520 Windows Phone is all good! The six-inch screen is much sharper with better resolution, and provides easier to read text and webpages on the larger screen. The faster processor (quad-core) and more memory provides much better performance for all functions and features. The 1520 is about the size as a desktop phone handset to hold and use for phone calls, so for me the larger size phone is not a problem and audio call quality is excellent. I chose a horizontal belt-loop carry case to carry it around, and that works for me. Battery capacity is good for my typical all-day use, and data-intensive activities seem to be the biggest battery drain. After an overnight recharge, its ready for another business day. I'm still discovering the newest features and functions. So far, the Cortana voice-assist has worked very well, and voice recognition (of my voice) and the Cortana answers have been spot-on and quick. I do most of my business work on a laptop, but this 1520 is serving as an excellent device for a mobile extension to my office. I haven't tried Skype yet, but the Lumia Cameras (both selfie and front-facing) are excellent and produce very high quality images (20 MP front-facing). Since the phone purchase, I received and applied one Windows 8.1 Update via AT&T (downloaded using WiFi connection) that was uneventful, auto-restarted three times (included both firmware and OS upgrades) during the upgrade process, and resulted in better performance on all levels. Almost a replacement for a laptop - getting closer anyway.",

            "body": "My 5th Windows phone since switching from iPhone 4s. Software as usual was excellent... Very stable and reliable with all the normal functions I use every day working flawlessly, intuitively and quickly. Biggest use of my phone is at work where I rely on Onenote, Word, Excel, Xbox Music and Audible to get me through my day. On the hardware side Nokia gets it right again... With a high end processor the speed never fails to impress the screen is a joy to look at and the super sensitive touch works perfectly while riding my dirt bikes with gloves. Additionally the phone is pretty thin, takes abuse (though I have a case) and has second to none battery life (Literally: http://wmpoweruser.com/nokia-lumia-1520-demonstrates-amazing-battery-life-in-gsmarena-test/). Only downside I can think of is occasional mis-calibration of the display brightness when set to auto (comes up way too dim) but always corrects its self within 10 seconds and occurs pretty infrequently when you unlock the phone... Basically a non issue. As far as apps go I have everything I want though I am not a huge mobile gamer so I can comment on that but my phone currently has 325 apps on it about 80-100 of which get used once a week or more and includes all the big name apps (most of which were missing when I first got my phone. As few frequently used common sample: Facebook Facebook page manager (full feature client for managing pages like businesses, events and causes) Chase bank Etrade financial Youtube (though I normally use one of the many excellent third party clients since the 1st party app isn't as good) Unit converter Flashlight Amazon Audible Netflix WPtorrentpro (bit torrent client) Dominoes Pizza Maaloo Outdoors (a outdoor mapping and tracking client that allows saving of track including import and export with dropbox and skydrive support... Great for ATV/Dirt biking, hiking, etc)",

I've had the 920 and the 925 recently, and I was expecting this phone to be at least on par with the other two but I was not expecting it to be leaps and bounds ahead. It exactly that however. Visually, the device is similar to the 920 in design. Larger, thinner, and far more powerful. For those who are appcentric, make certain that apps you use everyday are on this platform before you switch. Once you've decided that excellent telephony trumps apps, it's a no brainer. The 1520 brings top of the line specs to the table whether you're looking for resolution, screen size, expandability, performance, or longevity. It's all here. My average battery life is 32 hours. the downside is the dialer, it's massive and often requires two hands to dial. The work around is to use live tiles, or to use bluetooth or voice control dialing which is superb.",

It fits fine in a jacket pocket but not so much in a pants pocket. The larger display is great and the battery lasts for several days. The Windows 8 display and navigation takes awhile to get used to. I have Windows 8 on my touch-screen PC and almost never use it as the Windows 7 format works fine. Now that I appreciate the advances in Windows Phone 8, maybe I'll use Windows 8 (PC version) more. Setting up the synchronizing of email was easy, but syncing the calendar and contacts took quite an effort. The Microsoft, AT&T, and Nokia web sites have instructions for syncing, but it is not clear which software and platforms are used in each process. My Windows 8 PC runs both Outlook mail and Windows mail. Google hosts my mail. AT&T provides the communications service. Nokia also has some server processes. I ended up with multiple email accounts, contact lists, and calendars on my PC before getting the right combination on the phone. Downloading apps is easy and fast from the MIcrosoft Store. Initially I was concerned that a couple of my old favorites were not programmed for Windows Phone, but most others are now available. The apps start up and run fast, and the display makes them easier to use.",

            "body": "I purchased this phone from a third party Amazon retailer as used. The retailer was honest about the phone and described what was good about it and what was not so good about it. I purchased a replacement rear camera lens that was previously broken and identified by the seller. The phone worked flawlessly. I was able to upgrade the phone to a newer version of Windows Phone and am very happy with it. I have owned this Nokia Lumina 1520 for several months now and like everything about it that it is NOT. Mainly it is NOT an Apple iPhone which is what this Nokia Replaced, and yes, I just slid my AT&T sim card out of my iPhone and into the Nokia. Works perfectly and was able to move my contacts easily from my old phone to this one. The Nokia 1520 is a big phone, more like a phablet than a phone. This smartphone is not for everyone's taste as it is large, somewhat cumbersome, but takes awesome pictures and video. I feel more comfortable with the Windows interface rather than Apple. Apple makes a great phone but I really got tired of the hype and how much I needed the bleeding edge of their technology, so I got off the train and went to Nokia. Now that Nokia has sold their phone business to Microsoft, I may have a different opinion with the next generation of Surface Phone or whatever they are going to call it. I may keep what I have for a few more years and not upgrade at all, I am that happy with it now.",

Low-light is good. Close-ups are very good. The cool thing is the very tight integration with the Windows operating system which makes sharing, viewing and editing files between computer and phone very easy. The app store does not have as wide a selection as Apple or Android, but most of the popular ones are there, and there is almost always an app that will do the job. Battery life is good. I can usually go about a day and a half before it needs a charge, but I'll typically charge it at night, so it's very rare that I run out of power.

I have a boom holder on my bed frame which holds this phone and I can watch Netflix all day without having my hands get tired. The battery life is great and the Nokia apps are ahead of their time.

I used an online mic test for it and i picked up noise if i got really close to the mic port. I might try to see if i can get my phone repaired. This phone was posted as Refurbished, and it did look refurbished but Refurbish wasn't what happened with the mic. My parents said if its refurbished that means they checked everything to see it work. I can still use my phone but its hard to record life moments without audio and to talk to friends.",

            "body": "I wanted the latest an greatest Windows Phone device and at the time I purchased this, this was it. Now the darling Windows Phone is the Lumia Icon on Verizon. Hopefully the international version of the Lumia Icon gets released soon. It is the Nokia 930. I will then be able to put that on my AT&T line of service. In the meantime, this is the top of the line Lumia on AT&T. It has better specs than the Lumia 1020 except for the Camera. The 1020 has the awesome 41 megapixel camera, whereas this phone has a still-awesome, 20 megapixel camera. This phone is fast, but not noticeably faster than other Windows Phones. This even includes my AT&T Windows Phone Nokia 520. The only, and I really mean only, issue I have with this phone is its massive 6 inch screen. It still fits in my work pants (khakis in an IT office). The phone is wider and taller than everything else. It is a mini-tablet in every respect. That is not to say that this screen is bad. It is a beautiful screen, perfect for watching movies. The Clear Black technology is great and is easy to read outdoors. I recently upgraded to Windows Phone 8.1 Developer Preview without a hitch. This update makes Windows Phone even better than it already was. This a great phone, if you have big hands, are over 6 feet tall, and/or are looking for a Windows Phone \"phablet\". PS: I am primarily and Android user, who used to be primarily an iOS user. I have multiple phone lines, which include an iPhone, a HTC One, and this Nokia. I occasionally buy phones such off contract, such as my Nexus 5 and the Nokia 520.",

            "body": "I wanted to come on here and add to the reviews, lol with all the buzz around the iPhone 6 now. I have had my Lumia 1520 since last December and I absolutely love it! I loved it before the recent Windows Phone 8.1 upgrade and now, after that, I love it waaay more! It's almost like a new phone but within the same hardware. Upgraded interface! On to the review - I'm not much of a techie so I'm not going to list a review of every feature. Of course the camera is great and really everything else. I will go through some things I really love about it. Cortana is really awesome. I don't think it is operating yet at full capacity- meaning I don't think I've untapped all of its capabilities yet, but it is really cool. It doesn't talk to me as much as I would like but that's probably because I don't really talk to it - I still feel a little weird talking to my phone! I didn't go through the whole Siri thing, as I never liked the iPhone interface. Back to the phone & Cortana: I love the daily snapshot it gives me - tailored to me from all the things I told it. I love the reminders it gives me - telling me that its time to leave and the traffic, to get to an appointment. Its really helpful. I love the slide down notifications and expanded volume control. I love the new texting style - makes typing a lot of words possible in a really short time! and is so effortless! I love the new update to the already cool live tiles! The transparent background is awesome! I love the new glance screen - the update is just that much cleaner! And of course I've always loved the overall look - both the build of the phone and the interface. I appreciate the interface over a Droid or iPhone interface any day, and furthermore don't get how soooo many people aren't turned on to Window Phone's interface instead! I think Microsoft needs to do better advertising! Maybe stop showing Windows Phones in comparison to Apple. I mean that's great and all - people need to see a comparison but a lot of the earlier ads - that kind of comparison just makes it seem like you're constantly showing Apple as the standard that you're trying to catch up to (standard in popularity of course) but they need to show how Windows Phone stands in its own class! Lastly I really hope they continue to improve the phone. If they continue to make jumps like they did with this WP8 to WP8.1 - they will be lightyears ahead of the competition!!",

My last one dropped and cracked a few days ago, so I purchased a refurb phone and restored from the back up (one drive) took 20 mins and it's like I never left. I love the Screen size first 6 inch phone, the color is wonderful and visible in direct light. The camera is a must have 20mpx makes this thing glimmer compared to other high end smart phone cameras. Built in NFC and Wireless charging is great (Non At&t model they remove that) (don't recommend the charging case it has no protection and is the reason my last one is dead). The WiFi support AC making this phone fly when connected to a good home network. Windows 10 loads well but heats the phone up and kills battery lift (went back to 8.1 update 3 denim). There are a lot of apps for this phone and using it with Office is great! Hook this phone up to a wireless display using Miracast (no lag) hook in a keyboard Bluetooth and mouse and you have a nice mini PC. I can not say enough good about this phone, wish the corners were not so pointy but other wise great look feel and design. All Windows phone should be like this one.",

And the 1520 is exactly that! I'm supper satisfied with my purchase from the gizmo trade. Everything works and runs super smooth. I had to cut my sim card to size cause the 1520 takes a Nano sim. And thankfully it worked. Wouldn't recommend everyone to that. I even updated it to windows 10 and it got even better! Shipping was super quick. I ordered on a Friday at 5:00pm and was delivered by the following Monday at 2:00 pm. No bull this phone is humangus!",

This phone out performs my old iPhone in every way! The only down fall is that yes, the app store is somewhat limited, but its okay, because the great increase in screen size allows me to do more on the web! There is a bit of a learning curve, but it is easy to use once you found it out. Now, as a testament as to how durable the phone is! The fourth day I had the phone, I dropped it out of my car and accidentally kicked it into the snow bank. I didn't realize it at the time and the phone spent 13 hours in a pile of snow. It literally was encased in ice, but after thawing it out for about an hour, I was able to resume my angry birds game where I had left off. The ice seems to have had no effect what so ever. Not even a scratch. This phone is a tank! I didn't even have a case on it!!!",

This is a screen that you can get some serious consumption done. Windows phone operating system is the best in the market place, modern sleek, information driven--and just down right cool! The apps, can not think of anything I want to do where there isn't a very good app that lets me do it. Fast-wow, is this thing fast, external storage add 64gig with an sd card, sound, loud and full. The camera--wow, nothing on the market beats it except for the lumia 1020. Except for the herd mentality of the American market place, this phone would be on every top seller list!

The operating system is exemplary and contains numerous refinements that are simply outstanding. There is a sensing function that detects the amount of ambient light, and it adjusts the color scheme of the display to ensure maximum readability. I am very impressed with this. The call quality is a little muddy when using the speakerphone function. But it isn't bad enough to take a star off. (I'm not convinced the sometimes-muddy quality is caused by the phone exclusively.) I would say that the overall call quality is good, but not pristine. The expandable memory is a plus. I've taken some unwarranted flack about the Lumia 1520's Windows operating system. This is by far the best mobile operating system available. To my personal perspective, Apple's OS is for simple people. Android is very good, but I have had one android device fail inexplicably. But this Windows OS does things that I truly appreciate. I liken my transition from android to windows to driving an old Jeep, and then upgrading to a Mercedes S-500. Simply put, it is just better.",

            "body": "This is a big phone and will certainly not be for everyone. After watching some reviews online I still did not get the true size until I held it the first time. That said, it is a pretty awesome device. * The screen is truly amazing. It is clear, crisp and responsive and an absolute joy to work on. But at full brightness, it does suck the battery pretty fast. * The Windows Phone 8 OS is coming along nicely and although you will miss some apps (waiting impatiently for FlipBoard) I have found that it addresses all my day to day needs. (see notes below) * Speed is awesome and games like Asphalt 8 runs brilliantly. * The ATT version only has 16GB of Memory for Apps and no wireless charger. (Thanks for that). But not the phones fault. * I added a 32GB micro SD Card for extra media. * The camera is awesome. 20MP is more than enough for most users. * Browsing the web on this device is pretty good. The big screen helps So, Windows Phone 8. The OS got a bad wrap and although there are still some major issues / missing features it is definitely getting better. The user experience is great and fresh when compared to iOS that despite it's makeover, is pretty stale. Things that I miss are: * VPN support (coming) * Notification center (coming) .... not much else The app gap is closing fast and if Microsoft does go in the direction that some media outlets are reporting (dropping royalty fees for Windows Phone [unconfirmed]) we should hopefully see an explosion of devices to challenge android. Since the OS will only get better, I'm happy with my purchase.",

No drops, no water boarding, no opening of the phone. To repair - it meant replacing the entire motherboard - about 1/2 the price of the phone. Was ***great*** while it worked - very good camera, really good screen and surprisingly good battery life (2-3 days on a full charge). Still using it on Wi-Fi only as a tablet - was too big as a day to day phone anyway. Disclaimer: I was a Nokia Lumia fan (900, 950, 1020, 1520) and now moved to Microsoft mid level line (650) - that inherited the hardware and all the good software from Nokia.",

            "body": "This is my second Nokia 1520. The first one had its issues but this second one infuriates me. The hardware is fantastic. The phone is fast, the screen is very large and looks great, the camera takes good pictures and video, the processor is fast, etc. However the software is terrible. The interface is great, much better then IOS and Android but it ends there. This phone has more problems then I can possibly list but I'm going to mention just a few. * Phone locks up on a daily basis for no reason. * Camera locks up almost every time it's used. * Locks up when switching from still camera to video. * Intermittent keyboard shows up when it feels like it. Phone must be rebooted. * Bluetooth is on but when call comes in it disconnects. * Must be rebooted when entering a new wifi area (such as between home and work). * Copy and paste only works sometimes. * Deletes contacts randomly. * Deletes apps randomly. * Randomly turns itself off. * Music app randomly deletes downloaded music. * Settings change on their own. * Rebooting takes up to five minutes. * Email system has many flaws. * No YouTube app and all aftermarket ones stink. * Low amount of apps available but not a huge issue. * Alarm is not usable unless you keep your ringer on. What company would do that? There's really too many problems to list here. This phone is running WM10 and gets all of the updates. I keep a minimum amount of apps loaded to simplify problems. Cache cleaner and performance apps are run weekly. Reloading WM10 hasn't helped. Windows has a great opportunity to be the leader in cell phone operating systems but they just can't seem to get their act together. Too bad. Skip it. NOTE: Do not buy a phone from BREED. They sold me a new phone that was clearly used. Amazon was going to make good on it and take it back but I was in the middle of moving to a different state and couldn't return it.",

I have been using it for two days and all functions appear to be working correctly. I installed my own AT&T nano sim card with no problem. I also installed a 50gb micro sd card. I like this phone because: 1-I like the Windows Phone OS. It came with Windows Phone 8.1 installed. 2-The large screen is easy to read. 3-The response is very fast. 4-Having a micro SD card slot is very useful and you do not have to take the phone apart to use it. 5-The screen display is bright and sharp. 6-I also bought the Amzer Pudding Soft Gel TPU Skin Fit Case which gives some protection to this large phone without adding additional size or weight. I recommend both this phone and the reseller.",

            "body": "It's a great device, simple to use and easy switch from iPhone. Screen is huge, easy to read and see. Little too big for a smaller hand, some times requires two hands to operate, so for work on a go while driving use voice feature to text and email. Not many apps just yet, but has everything I used on iPhone, so not a big deal. You will look goofy if you put this tablet to your ear, it's just that big and bulky. You will notice how fast this processor is, I do not wait for any app to open, almost instantaneous. If you like to take pictures, this thing has 20mgpixl cam, not as good as my wife's Lumia 1020, but much better then my iPhone. To have Office in your hand is a huge plus that Apple was not able to provide for me, I keep ton of files stored on my phone for easy access on a go. If you have small hands, this phone is not for you, go with a smaller screen like 1020.",

            "body": "I am a self admitted cell phone addict. i have various versions of iPhones up to IOS 7and Android phones up to Kit Kat. I became board with the same old stuff so I decided with some caution that I would make the switch to Windows Phone 8. I was very fearful of a lack of apps, but it turns out that the majority of the apps that I used on other platforms were available on WP8. The ones that weren't available had similar apps that were as good as or better than the original. The phone itself is a work of art. The build quality is every bit as good if not better than any model of iPhone. The screen is second to none in my opinion. Its bright, and the colors are incredible. Its very easy to read in sunlight. The button locations are very intuitive. The speaker is very loud and also clear. The battery life is amazing. I consider my self an average to slightly above average cell phone user. The phone comes off the charger at 4:15am every day. Buy the time I go to bed at 10:00pm I still have any where from 65 to 70 percent charge left. The phone is large. There is no question about that, but its also thin and feels very good in the hand. If you are looking for a large screen phone that does just about everything perfect, then look no further. The toughest choice you will have to make is which color to get.",

            "body": "I used to own a Galaxy Note I since its release, was happy with its size and the abundant apps but for the past 6 month I started to feel the pain for Android's lousy and slow software. The LTE can also suck all the power from a fresh charge in 6~8 hours, so I had to turn off ATT data network anywhere I can use WIFI. Last Friday I finally jumped to Lumia 1520. Now it has been 3 days and I can't express how happy I am! Here are few things I feel great about this phone: 1. The system is fast and smooth - hardly feel delay when switch apps. 2. Integration with Office makes open email attachment so convenient and productive 3. Photos took by the camera are crispy clear and I have not tried to adjust the settings yet. 4. Live tile, man, I love live tile. With a 6 inch screen and adjustable tile size, all my calendar appointments, the weather, the battery usage, the news app I installed, all dynamically displays like music. A quick glance and I know what is going on and what I will up to, no app launch is needed! 5. The voice enabled Nokia GPS drive is accurate, clear and LOUD, it will retire all your GPS device forever. 6. If you use Skydrive, the integration with Skydrive is really smooth and seamless. 7. Battery performance is exceeding my expectation. With LTE or WIFI (I even don't know which I am using now), after a relatively heavy 2~3 hour web usage and a full day random use, I can still have 50% power left by the end of the day. Now are few things I don't feel great about: 1. I really want to have the App/function to automatically mute my phone in working/sleeping hours but seems it is not supported on Windows phone 2. The phone is big as we know, so one hand dial is virtually impossible. If you are driving, even pick up the call will be a problem with one hand(I know, I know, don't drive and .....) 3. I still wish I can have those missed Apps I had on Android, comparing those app I installed on Galaxy Note (about 20 of them), I found all my apps in Windows Phone App store except 3 are not available. btw, anyone want to jump to windows phone, you can check here for available windows phone apps: [...] then you can decide if some critical Apps are missing when you switch the ship.",

Following are the few things I believe are the best in this phone compared to other phones ( I have some links towards the end to back my review ) * This phone has one of the best battery life, it has a huge 3400 mAh battery, and i generally have 50-60% left at the end of day (1) * This phone has one of the best screens. Full HD 1080p and the best outdoor visibility (2) * The second best camera in any phone right now, best being lumia 1020. 20MP camera which takes great photos in low light and OIS makes photos/videos crisp. OIS (optical Image stabilization) means the lens uses mechanical ball bearing and magnetically powered motors for stabilization during photo as well as video. Or put more simply the lens moves in the opposite direction to compensate for any small hand movements/vibrations to make the photo/video more stable. * To my knowledge, only two smartphones right now can shoot photos in RAW/DNG ( Lumia 1020 and Lumia 1520 ) (3) * One of the loudest and best speakers on any phone. No need to buy the small $100 portable bluetooth speakers, because the speakers on this phone are loud enough. * The best innovation in this phone is audio recording. Phone has 4 HAAC microphones, and allows directional audio capture for the best noise free recordings of events (4) * Nokia owns the Here Maps(Navteq) so you can download offline maps for anywhere in the world for free. Thats right, you have a worldwide GPS with the up-to-date maps. No need to use crazy amount of cellular data while using google maps or worrying about losing navigation when there is no data connection far from cities * I use my smartphone to check time, but hate clicking the power button every time. Lumia 1520 comes with Glance screen which is always on, shows time and notifications without touching the device. Uses only 4-5% extra battery a day. * Another Lumia exclusive feature is double tap to wake, comes in very handy while phone is sitting on your desk. * In cold weather ability to use your phone with any gloves, also comes in very handy versus buying special gloves for most other phones. This is a large phone, so be mindful of the size before u order. It fits comfortably in my pocket(even jeans), and my hand ( I dont have giant hands). I picked my wife's iphone 4 recently and it felt like a flip phone. Its amazing how quickly we adapt, whats normal to us changes quick. I am of the opinion a large display phone (phtablet) is better than owning two separate devices (phone and tablet). Almost everyone who sees my phone makes a comment, but i have noticed that only iphone users are generally almost hostile about the size of Lumia 1520. iphone users think owning an iphone is cool, but in reality something that 50% of the population owns cannot be cool by definition. I am not saying owning a Nokia makes you cool automatically but an iphone is def not cool anymore. Also, many of these iphone users might run to buy a bigger phone when apple makes one (5) Android is a great option too but I wouldn't buy an android phone because of the malware issue (6) and in general of google poilcies, in Eric Schmidt's own words (7) So to wrap up i think this is one of the best smartphones hardware wise and Windows Phone is a great OS, so if you are in the market for a new phone give this a try, go to your local At&T store play with it and more competition means us the consumer wins.

            "body": "I have four of these phones. The first one I bought new, but dropped the poor thing and the screen gradually went black and unusable. So I bought three used ones from different sellers. Tip: Do not upgrade to windows 10, it will totally mess it up. I upgraded two of them, I am glad I still have one left with windows 8.1. One of the used ones barely works if not plugged in, so I bought a little solar charger which can be charged with a wall outlet as well and it is happy. I use one as a phone and it works circles around any other brand of phone when it comes to conference calls. The battery on that one never quits, it is totally amazing. They take excellent printable pictures and edit pictures to look their best. Windows 10 lost all my contacts three times (!) but because I have so many of them, the app \"Transfer my Data\" restored them from one of my other phones. Windows 10 will not show thumbprints on the pinned website, which makes that feature useless to me. One of my phones I overloaded with pictures and it quit. So I let it rest in a drawer and then deleted all these (hundreds) of pictures. Now it works fine. I think I can resurrect the phone that doesn't want to work unless it is plugged in by deleting the pinned explorer pages. Might as well since it doesn't show thumb prints. I had upgraded to windows 10 with it hoping it will help the battery life, but it didn't.",

            "body": "My 5s was smashed to oblivious (in a liferpoof case too.. weird?). So I figured it was time for something new. I was very hesitant, nervous, and first question I asked ATT was (when can I return it?). It was huge, bold, loud, and shiny, and seemed cool on the surface. I went over my head, being a cloud advocate, everything I would have to do (contacts.. iCloud calendars, pictures, tasks, email accounts..) Before this, it was seamless, get a new iPhone, plug in my icloud account, and boom... done.. But sometimes seamless is boring.. Here's the things for you iPhone advocates you will have to do without.. lets get that out there now. (I have a iMac, MacBook, two ipads, wife has iPhone, AppleTV etc... all connected under one account) - iCalendar is gone on this phone. You can access a very mundane version of it through the phones IE browser, but it's impossible to read, zoom out, navigate, or add / edit events - iCloud storage is gone. There is no storage access with Apple's iCloud, completely different system - The beloved iMessage is gone. If you have friends on the iMessage system, they better get used to the old \"green\" text and using cellular to get in contact with you. No way around that unless you use apps like facebook, whatsapp etc... - Photostream is gone - And a bunch of obvious things because it's Windows, not Apple Now here is why I LIKE this phone - The screen is gorgeous. Hands down, best screen on the market, 6\" full 1080p deliciousness - 20MP Cam with 1080p. The picture quality is ridiculous. And paired with the Nokia Creative app, you can bust out some almost pro-like DSLR type photos with high quality video - The phone itself. For being such a monstrosity of a phone, it feels great to hold. Landscape view is awesome, and it actually fits my pocket just fine (I'm a dude who wears pants, no murse) - The live-tiles, OS, and navigation is top-bar quality. The phone is just fun to navigate through, and with high quality apps. (Weave, MixMusic, News etc...) The ability to rearrange to your liking from size, colors, live tyles, backgrounds etc is awesome. The updates on the tiles are a plus, one thing you don't have with iPhone (widgets for Android comes to mind). Easily spot weather updates, any news.. updates to facebook etc.. - CPU. This thing is fast.. opening apps, switching between apps, it just so responsive and barely has a hiccup - Games / Video etc... Gaming is great on this thing. If you're an XBOX ONE user, using this as a second screen is pretty sweet. The games for the phone itself are pretty quality, look great, and the extra space with the screen size is a plus. Watching videos on this thing is on par with your quality tablets out there In conclusion.... Though this is a step away from what I'm used to with Apple, it's been a welcome change. I've tried Android and could not get into, and did not like it all. This however, being windows based, has been pretty awesome. And so far I'm satisfied. If you are a iPhone user, I don't think the transition will be bad unless you were a heavy cloud user, you'll have to switch from everything Apple based, to Windows cloud based (onedrive, sky drive.. etc...). All in all superb phone, definitely will hang onto this one for a year, until the next thing lol..",

            "title_review": "This Lumia really looms...",
            "body": "... but I don't mind it. Yep, it's the biggest Windows Phone out there and a rival for the Android \"phablets\" out there, but this one has better internals than any of them, on top of a much more user-friendly user experience. That's right, WP8 has been around long enough for me to say it without fear of immediately being burnt at the stake: Windows Phone is a faster, better mobile OS than Android. Power users will sometimes complain about the lack of one or two apps upon which they rely on the other system, and while that's legitimate in some cases, I've found WP to do everything I need a phone to for years now. I am an Android user as well, and my Nexus 7 sees plenty of use, but I wouldn't want Google's OS as my go-to device for communication. WP8's core features are so bullet-proof and fast to use that I am sure I will be sticking with them for my phone for a long time, even though I'm invested in Android's ecosystem on my tablet. The best thing to happen for WP has definitely been Nokia's risky business move to exclusively focus on this OS. Their hardware is simply beautiful, as well as reliable (I've used the 900 and 920 for quite awhile) and top-notch. When you hold them and use them, their devices have every bit as much appeal as do Apple's, but they don't even come close to overlapping. Nokia's design is focused on color, freshness, sleekness and practicality. I remember talk when the first Lumia, the 800, came out of how the phone hardware mimicked the OS's bright and bold but utilitarian design, and they've kept that mentality going. Last year's flagship was the 920, then the 1020 with its beastly camera stepped in with upgraded specs, and the slimmer 925 also made an appearance, but as an overall poster child of what OS and hardware can do together, the real king is the 1520. You can read over the specs for yourself: 1080p IPS display, Snapdragon 800 quad-core 2.2GHz processor, 20MP optically-stabilized camera. Those sound great. But even great specs don't mean everything, the key thing is if they work. They work! The 1520 is a massive phone, but it is all polish, with no real faults to find. The whole phone runs at blazing speed with the top-end processor. Size is the major factor in whether this phone appeals to you. Photos don't really do it justice - you have to see it in the polycarbonate to grasp how large it really is. That said, it uses its size in the best way possible: the beautiful screen. I love IPS technology; its color reproduction is excellent, not only saturated and vivid but accurate, and such things matter on a 6\" screen. The back of the phone is Nokia-standard toughpolycarbonate, either matte or glossy (in the case of the colorful versions - I've only seen the red, so I can't be totally sure on the others). I prefer the higher-quality feel of the matte on any Nokia device, but with this one it's especially important, because you need grip to hang onto such a large device. To be sure, its weight is quite reasonable, just heavy enough to feel solid and reliable, but there are lots of times I don't have my fingers locked around its edges, but am letting it lie in my palm while I use it. The matte finish of the black phone sticks just enough to the surface of my palm to be comfortable doing so. The 1520 is also nicely thin. In fact, I think its dimensions and weight are close to perfect. They scream good design. The OS update that allows three rows of live tiles comes in especially handy, since you can get almost everything you need onto the screen without scrolling, and even with large tiles, which report a lot of information on what is going on with the app, making this an even better glance-worthy device than the other WP models. Lastly, the camera is on par with other Nokia models (not including the 1020, which is a class unto itself) in performance, with a couple of caveats. One, the maximum aperture is somewhat smaller (f/2.4 instead of f/2.2 on the 920), meaning that this camera has to bump ISO sooner than the 920 in low light. You can still set ISO manually, which I recommend. ISO 100 shots look buttery-smooth. This is also the first camera on a Nokia device to support RAW (DNG) files, which I have yet to test in Lightroom but am looking forward to getting my hands on. All in all, this phone is impressive enough to warm a person who thinks \"phablets\" are dumb, which incidentally was me. I'm more than willing to make the size trade-off for the many excellent features the 1520 boasts, and am looking forward to what Nokia and Microsoft have in store for their new flagship device!",

            "body": "This morning I dropped my phone without realizing it while walking through the lawn in the rain. It sat out in the rain for about ten minutes before I realized what happened and went looking for it. It still works, which prompted me to write this review. This is the third Windows Phone that I have owned and, without question, the best phone I have ever owned. My wife has a Galaxy Note 3, which I liked so much that I nearly got one for myself, but, after seeing her experience with it after owning it for nearly a year, I'm glad I didn't. My battery lasts triple the time of most phones that I see and I can easily get through 24 hours with only about 30 minutes to an hour on the charger. It's such a pleasure to use on a daily basis; the newest features (Cortana, voice text, swipe keyboard, etc) are incredible and I use them daily. Everything tends to \"just work\", which is a great thing for a phone. I need functionality from my computer, but I need speed and ease-of-use from my phone and that's one are in which the Windows Phone platform beats out most Android phones. It's built like a tank; I have dropped it multiple times and there is barely a scratch. I will admit, there are times when it's size can be awkward, but I feel that all the times when it's so nice to have a big screen (watching movies, reading, playing games, showing pictures) outweigh any inconvenience. Some recommendations:don't buy the 32GB model. You can buy a 64GB microSD card (under 40 on Amazon) for less than the difference in cost and end up with more space than you will ever use. I'm also on the developer's preview build of the Windows Phone OS; I wouldn't recommend that to most people as the current release has all of the features you want with less bugs. It's nice to get a lot of features ahead of release but they tend to be buggy.",

            "body": "Let me start by saying this phone is amazing.This is my 6th windows phone in a span of 1 year. I keep phone maximum for 3 months and sell it with good value. Earlier i had Lumia 1020 which is amazing phone too. I was in market for a mini ipad.Then i came across this phone . So i thought why not buy Lumia 1520 which can be used as a mini tablet and phone.I have no regrets in buying this phone. Below is my experience with this phone. Form Factor: Yes phone is little big. As this is a phablet category, the size is expected.We cant have a SUV's room in a compact car. So the benefits of large screen is obvious. Also at the same time there will be some inconvinience. Both Hands: Yes most times you need to use both hands. For instance, you cant use back button without using 2nd hand. But i got used to it.After couple weeks ownership , i dont feel this as a inconvinience any more. It matters most in a CAR where you need to handle the phone single handed. So all the time i mount my phone and i can use single hand. Screen: Screen is great and retina. But if you use phone screen without any protector then the screen is very slippery. Camera: Didnt test much but looks as good as lumia 1020 with less zoom. Slim. This phone is very slim when compared to lumia 1020. there is no bulge on the back so it sits flat.I se phone for movies at gym. Lumia 1020's camera bulge was always a chalange at gym. As 1520 sits flat, it is more secure. Speed: I dont think i see much speed improvement over 1020. Though it is quad core ,system still takes time to repsond on certain apps.I believe the speed has to do with particular apps then the phones hardware.When i switched to 1520 ,i thought some lagging in 1020 will be gone in 1520/. but certains apps still lagg. Lanyard: I miss Lanyard of lumia 1020 in this phablet. As this is a big phone, Nokia must have Lanyard option. To remedy this, i added my own . I used incipio air case and added Lanyard to the speaker grill. It works great as the case is strong. Speakers:It is almost same as lumia 1020 speaker with 10-15% improvement in volume. The clarity is same. Both speakers are great. Ear piece could be louder. I dont know but Nokia Lumia series suffers with low ear piece volume. Red Lumia. Red is slippery as every one suggested. Incipio case took care of it. Tiles: Extra column for tiles is a plus. Now one can see more information without moving the screen. Side Keys: Side keys are too flat. It is quite difficult to find volume keys and lock keys .It could be better like lumia 1020. Phone in public: Yes it is eye catching. It doesnt look good if you talk on this phablet in public. But who cares.when Iphone first came, it looked too BIG. but it has become new NORM now. So people will get used to it as phablets become more popular.Also it keep you out of crowd. Pocket: It easily slides into pocket. In my formals and jeans i have no issue in sliding the phone. It fits and doesnt pop out of pocket. As it is slim, the extra length doesnt bother me. Wireless charging. I am really mad on ATT on removing wireless charging from this phone. Hell with the technology and standards. IF they care too much then why did they sell qi wireless chargers. Now that every one got one qi wireless chargers they removed this from phone.ATT ------ in this regard. battery: Awesome. It has very good battery life.It is almost twice that of lumia 1020. I tested battery by turning on everything.Even though the location was turned on, the battery drain was not significant. I believe if location is not used by any app then system turns it off.",

            "title_review": "Behold: the Slablet!",
            "body": "The short summary: I've been a long-time user of Android phones but a few months ago I decided to try the move to a Windows Phone. I thought I'd miss some of the goodies, but the truth is, Windows Phone has been great. I bought this through AT&T Next--I don't want to bore you with AT&T details, but I'll put some of that info at the end for anybody who wants to know. The Lumia 1520 is great hardware, but will take some getting used to because of its size. Being bigger than a Phablet but only slightly more portable than a tablet, this slab-like body I have dubbed \"The Slablet\". The full review: About the phone The Nokia Lumia 1520 is very thin for its width and height. It barely fits in a pocket, but it doesn't take up much space once it's there. The screen is huge, nearly filling the front, and the slight raised bump on the back for the camera lens isn't very noticeable. The black body feels tactile and not slick, with a matte finish, but I went one extra step and skinned it with the Skinomi TechSkin that makes it look like woodgrain. It takes big hands to be able to wrangle this phone: it's skinny, but it's a big slab just the same. If you can get used to this, then the size pays off in the quality of the screen. The OLED screen is very bright and it auto-dims very well in various conditions. No screen seems to do well in direct sunlight, but I have to credit Nokia because this one comes very close. The battery charges fairly quickly, but the battery usage is amazingly good: I tend to top off the charge every 2 or 3 days instead of having to worry whether I have to charge up every night. Side note: while we're on the subject, the Lumia charging pad does NOT work. The manual says it is supported, but as you will see in reviews of the charging pad, it doesn't work on the 1520: the power induction technology was changed and isn't compatible. The phone powers up and down very quickly, apps respond fast on launch, and the sound quality is very good in standard phone calls, so-so in speakerphone, and excellent in Bluetooth. There aren't anywhere near as many apps in the Windows Phone Store as there are in Google's Play Store or Apple's store, but I've found plenty to do whatever I wanted (including ports of popular games like Angry Birds). There is a KitKat Launcher app that will run the Droid OS on Windows, and it runs pretty well...but I haven't found that to be a \"port my old apps\" solution because it doesn't have the ability to run the Play Store and pull down my apps--some side-loading required. Eventually I realized I just didn't need some of the things I used before because Windows Phone has an equivalent. The camera takes wonderful high-resolution 20MP images. Using it is easy: even with the phone locked, you can turn it sideways in your hands, hold it like a traditional point-and-shoot camera, and use the button on the 'top' right to snap pictures, adjusting your shooting (or video) settings with the touchscreen. The flash works very well, and it's rare that I move around enough to cause motion blur. Pinch-to-zoom works, but more importantly the Nokia Camera app (recently rebranded \"Lumia Camera\") will let you adjust the most minute \"manual mode\" settings that any camera pro would love to play with, such as ISO, flash settings, etc. There's also a built-in image editor that I've used to tweak color balances, crop, and otherwise adjust images to save me the trouble of loading them into an image editing program on a computer. About the Windows Phone OS If you've used Windows 8 or an Xbox One or a Surface tablet, you've already been exposed to how the OS behaves. Every app has a square tile that represents it, and the tiles are large and easy to tap on. The main screen lets you put whatever tiles on it you like, and they scroll from top to bottom--but if you need one that's not on the main screen, a quick swipe to the right will pull up the list of everything on the phone. The Phone OS runs very smooth, launching apps quickly and multi-tasking well: I can run music via Bluetooth while navigating on the maps and when a phone call comes in, it all gets handled easily--and most importantly, consistently. The interface will pretty much look and feel the same for most of the apps that you use: you have some buttons for interaction, you have an ellipsis button \"[...]\" that brings up options, and the menus are large, bright text on a black background. Swiping and flipping around in the settings is fast and easy. I like the fact that the dialing menu makes it easy to flip through call history, contacts, speed dial, and voicemail, and that voicemail messages are pulled down to the phone and can be played like any media player app, with play/pause buttons. The only app that misbehaves is Facebook, and that seems to be the rule these days on more than one device I used it on. Facebook's interface is inconsistent and its behavior sometimes gets weird. I haven't had a single app crash on the phone, but Facebook comes close. So let's talk a moment about the details: Cortana. This voice-driven virtual assistant was a brilliant idea. After interviewing personal assistants for executives, celebrities, and more, the product team came up with a personality that is intended to handle your every need through voice interaction. This is a great app, but unfortunately only when it works. For example, I said, \"Cortana, set up an recurring appointment on my calendar, for every Monday and Wednesday, starting on January first. Name the appointment \"Yoga\".\" Believe it or not, this worked. But then I try something I read on a website about Cortana, and instead of it providing me an interactive response, Cortana brings up a Bing search on my screen and leaves me to figure it out. And yet...I was running the other day and she popped into my Bluetooth to tell me I just got a text message. We talked our way through playing it back to me, repeating it, and then calling the person back, all without touching a button. So when it works, it works well...and when it doesn't, you just wish it were consistent. OneDrive: this used to be called SkyDrive, and it's Microsoft's built-in online storage. I use OneDrive all the time with no real fuss. I can count on it to automatically upload my photos and videos, I can open documents I have stored out there, and it's actually more hassle-free on the phone than it can be on a PC. I don't currently run Office on my phone because I have a Surface Pro, but it does appear that the integration with Windows Phone for Office is probably better than the weird and limited versions of such apps on Android. Mail: Outlook looks and feels like the browser-based version, but seems to behave a little better. I've also added my Gmail accounts and the UI looks and behaves the same, but they appear as separate icons on the main screen. Maps and Driving: this is probably the only sticking point with a Windows Phone: Microsoft's identity crisis with Nokia. The Maps app works very well and is easy to work with. It gives driving directions by voice or lets you just view step-by step text instructions. There are two Nokia apps on the phone (Here Drive+ and My Commute) that are fantastic...but limited. So for example, the tile for My Commute regularly shows me how long it's going to take me to drive home, and gives a red exclamation point if there are any reported accidents along the way. Microsoft's Bing Maps updates traffic about every 2 minutes. When I'm driving, if I go a different route, both apps make a note of it, and amazingly enough, I get tiles at the top of the screen showing me the approximate times for each route, so I can know which one has the worst traffic. All of this works because there's a handoff under the covers between My Commute, Here Drive+ and Bing Maps. But sometimes when I launch My Commute, it doesn't make the handoff and it never gets started tracking the commute. Other times, it's supposed to present me with the Start button and it doesn't come up--the main screen just gives me options to add more commutes or delete one. The same happens with Here Drive+, sometimes I ask it to give me directions and it doesn't launch Bing Maps. Or it doesn't give me voice. Another app that when it works, is amazing, and when it doesn't, you just wish it were consistent. In the end, the Nokia Lumia 1520 is a really good overall data device: it is almost as capable as a full-blown tablet and it's also a great piece of hardware for a phone. The features of the Windows Phone OS range from amazing to mediocre, but overall it can do just about any basic day-to-day task that you might expect a smartphone to do. Microsoft have done a good job of marrying the OS to the device, with a few awkward Nokia-app fumbles here and there. Overall if you're looking for a Windows Phone, this is the best model that has the ability to add storage. You should probably try to get your hands on one first though to see if this is really something for your hands that you will be willing to haul around. AT&T Next info: to be honest, I spent more time agonizing over whether to take the plunge with their plan than I did over whether to switch to Windows Phone. After research, phone calls to AT&T Customer Service, and some support Chat sessions, I finally figured it out. The newest smartphones always cost hundreds of dollars, and the days where a phone company was willing to eat those costs to get your business are coming to an end. AT&T gives you a bit of upgrade leeway with Next because even though you're effectively agreeing to buy the phone at full price and stretch out the payments, there's also a certain window towards the end of that time where you can walk away from the payments and trade up...so long as, like in the past, you're entering into a new agreement. The \"incentive\" they give you is that Next users have access to cheaper monthly plans (and this can get really complicated if you dig into it)...for us, it didn't lower our already-good family plan, but it did mean we could keep said plan, where other AT&T upgrade offers would take features away or add costs. Not a pleasant situation, but also not much of an option given that where I live, AT&T dominates the airwaves.",

            "body": "I was a little skeptical about the size, however after owning this for about a month, I wouldn't go any smaller. Here's what I do to make it work. My frequently used icons/tiles are on the third column on the right. (Phone, messages, email etc.) Other tiles, I have on the left. This allows for any easy reach with my right thumb. It is difficult to reach the middle/top left tiles with one hand. I have placed tiles that typically require two handed use there. Battery life is unbelievable. I can go almost a day and a half with moderate-heavy usage. I have installed the 8.1 preview and although there may be a few bugs, this phone is rock solid smooth and fast. The display is awesome!! Cortana, although in beta has been very good. The voice recognition is fantastic!! The camera takes some incredible photos. I was a little skeptical about getting 16gb only. Knowing the device had a micro SD slot, and the software upgrade would support a memory card for app installation, I decided to go with it. I added a transcend 64gb SDXC Card type 10 and it works great. 80gb total!! OneDrive, Office, Nokia Drive - built in navigation with downloadable maps make this a complete package. Nokia Beamer is pretty cool too. The only thing I miss is the wireless built in charging (QI).",

            "body": "I have the ATT version of this phone which is missing the Qi Wireless Charging and only has 16GB of onboard storage. I 100% blame ATT for this not Nokia. As far as I'm concerned ATT is garbage. Pros Screen - Great colors, reading angles, and clarity. The screen has deep blacks and is very visable in direct sunlight due to the clearblack technology. The 3rd row of tiles on the hoimescreen is great. OS apps do take advantage of the larger screen size and show more text like in email, etc. Weight - The phone is not as heavy as I thought it would be. I previsouly had a L920 which has a lead weight. Camera - The 20MP camera is very good and fixes all of the issues that the L920 had. Polycarbonate Body - The L1520 is matte in white, which is what I have and it has a really great feeling. MicroSD - Many WP do not have MicrosSD, especially Nokias. This phone supports up to 64GB. You can only move media files to the storage right now (music, pictures, videos) not apps, but that is coming in WP8.1 I do not install tons of apps so this does not affect me. Cons Touch Input - The phone exhibits strange touch behaviour where scrolls are occassionally seen as touches. This is software and I'm sure Nokia will fix it, as they are very on top of issues. Size - At first the phone was a little bit to large, but after about 2 weeks it has been nothing but great. I will never get a smaller than 5\" - 5.5\" device again.",

I have a desk at home in my bedroom that holds some of my \"outdated\" backup phones. This currently includes a Nexus 4 and a Lumia 620. Every time I go to bed now, I look at my current phone, glance at my two \"old\" phones, and think to myself, \"how did I ever use those things??\" The Lumia 1520 really is that good. Now let me be clear, it is still a phone. It's not a life-changing event, it won't make you infinitely happy, but what it will do is just be one of the best companion devices you will ever own. The camera is phenomenal. The speed is just amazing. The Bing suite of apps and live tiles are just marvelous. The screen is gorgeous. As a user, I have no complaints. However, let me highlight a few complaints that others might have. They are valid, and if you fit into this category, the phone may not be the right one for you. I am merely saying that they don't bother me, not that they aren't valid complaints. 1) The Windows App Store selection is still limited. 2) The screen is large. 3) The camera is slightly slower to launch than the iPhone's. That's it. Really. I am not a fanboy per se, I've used all \"3\" of the big phones (Android, iPhone, Windows Phone) and sincerely think they are all awesome. However, for me, this device itself is what set it apart. I looked at the Note, I looked at the iPhone 5s, but I just could not stop playing with the 1520. That's my experience, and you might have a similar one.",

            "body": "First off, I'm not here to review the operating system. You can look elsewhere for that. Overall, I was presently surprised by this phone. The 1080p screen looks great and the color reproduction is a little saturated, which I prefer. The back housing looks good, but is a little slippery to hold making it a little prone to being dropped. Camera: Fantastic, the imaging software and camera itself is a perfect combination and I have yet to see a bad picture on auto function. The led flash is really bright(which also serves as a great flashlight). From my experience, the colors are not too unnaturally vibrant. Battery: I figured that a 3500mah battery would be to compensate for the enormous screen, but it turns out it goes even beyond that. I consider myself a pretty heavy user and this battery will only be at 40% by the end of the day. If you don't use it heavily, you can easily get two days out of this. Hardware: Windows phone 8.1 isn't a very can intensive os so with a snapdragon 800 this runs extremely fast. It does get a bit hot at times when playing games but it's never really been an issue. Wife connectivity seems about average and the vibration motor is much less obnoxious than other Nokia's. The speaker is nothing special, but does that really matter? Durability: I've dropped it face down on concrete a few times and have yet to see a scratch. It's built tough. I'm a Windows phone fan and this is perfect for anyone looking to get a packet because of how well it runs, and the durability of it as well as the camera. Update 9/8/14: Phone is still great, but just as a tip for users. If you plan on getting a screen protector for this don't buy a really cheap one. The phone has slightly curved glass so cheap protectors won't adhere to it very well. Also this phone looks to be one of the best WP devices for a long time to come still. Looks to be very time resistant.",

I've read reviews about how easily it breaks and that has not been my experience. It slid out of my pocket and hit the running board of my truck. It didn't break. It slipped out of my hand and hit the hardwood floor and didn't break. I generally find that most broken phones are the users fault. They treat a $300-500 phone like crap and then get pissy when it breaks. Learn how to take care of your stuff. Treat it well and it lasts. The camera takes pretty good pictures, front and rear. The speaker is quality. The screen resolution is excellent. A lot of people complain there is a lack of apps. If you're looking for the latest and greatest time wasters then you will be disappointed. I buy a phone to have it work for me not waste my time. The os is intuitive and easy to use. Don't like the tiles then download the app that makes it look more like android or iphone. Bottom line is this phone is great and the windows os is underrated because most people won't try it because they are locked in to their iPhone or android. I've used all the systems and this one is the best.",

Nokia of course makes solid hardware, fast processor plenty of storage (plus card if need more!). I don't know why Microsoft/Nokia aren't promoting the phone and OS more. It is a viable option, it could replace blackberry in the business space. It's not for everybody, but my wife uses the 1520 for work. Her Samsung could never reliably connect to the corporate email and vpn, no matter how much IT tried. Bought apps, still buggy. She travels worldwide and needed it to work, it didn't. With the Nokia she has had no problems at all. Some people just want to use the phone to actually get business done, not play games. Windows Phone and Nokia has been a very smooth transition, with no headaches and having to find some abstract setting to configure something that should work!!!",

            "body": "I decided to try out this Nokia with Win8 after owning an Android for the past 1.5 years (Galaxy 2 skyrocket - got it before the S3 came out). I also have an iphone 5 from my employer (replaced my old Blackberry). So one could say that I have experienced all 4 smart phone ecosystems. Before my Galaxy I owned the iPhone 3, 3GS and 4. Pros: Gorgeous screen - at 6 inches everything comes to life, and I can read the bloody thing. No longer do I have that claustrophobic feeling that I got from my other phone. The live tile metaphor on Win8 mobile works great - the tiles update so all you have to do is look at the screen. Great customization. Wonderful camera. Good battery life. Oh, and the interface is simple, does what you want without that 3rd party funkiness on Android. I actually enjoy using the apps to get the information I need. Syncing up to my PC is painless and fast, and transferring my itunes music and videos was ridiculously easy - versus the funkiness and slowness of the the Samsung Kies app on Android. App selection is decent - can't find WSJ online mobile, but at 6inches I can cruise the website! Other apps that I need are there including etrade mobile. Other thoughts on my other phones: Apple: Great OS, but you are locked into one way of doing things. And the bloody screen is small. Tim Cook needs to get a frackin' clue - I'm not 25 anymore, and I am tired of using my reading glasses to use the phone. And for the past two years I keep on hearing rumors that Apple is going to build a bigger phone, but they never do - I am tired of waiting. This is the biggest bust with the iPhone, and for me it is a serious one. I am not alone on this one, a couple of months back CNET blasted Apple on their screen size. Android: Cheap and ubiquitous. Samsung and Google are about to conquer the world with their duopoly, and that is not necessarily a good thing (privacy anyone?). At first glance the interface looks great, but has an inconsistency that is frustrating, especially between apps. If you like playing with the phone settings all the time versus using the phone for information and work, Android is the way to go. Syncing to the PC is a pain, and the transfer process is anything but straightforward. Android is the way to go if you want a cheap phone and you don't care about media.

As usual I did tons of research which drew me to the Lumia 1520. Interestingly one of the reasons I was drawn to it (its size) was the very reason I was apprehensive about getting it. But after some rationalizing I took the plunge. I have to say that this is one of the best purchase decisions I have ever made. At first its strikes you are being big but after a week it just feels normal and regular phones suddenly start looking too tiny to bother with. Plus I dont wear tight pants so it fits quite well in my pockets. The performance is top notch. No hitches or lags. I am quite impressed with the operating system. WP 8.1 is swift and smooth. There are more than enough apps for me to choose from to keep me productive and entertained. The browser is surprisingly good. And the battery life is awesome. You have no idea how much of a relief it is to be out whole day and into the night without worrying about battery life. As an avid photographer I love the camera on this thing. The first shot I took I was pleasantly surprised. The low light performance is great. This phone has controls you'll find on a DSLR camera. Being able to control shutter speed and focus manually opens a world of photographic possibilities. Lens apps are amazing. Reading this review suggest that you are considering getting this phablet. I have no reservations in recommending it. Its not perfect. But which device is? Prepare to get a lot of attention though when using it. It arouses a lot of curiosity and by the time I demonstrate a thing or two there are people saying they want one, except for those few who are brainwashed by Apple and Samsung marketing. One coworker did asked me to swap for his Note 3 though. All in all Im pretty happy with the 1520. And Id recommend it any day.",

I sold my 1020 because I was \"tired\" of being out of the loop when it came to apps, compatibility, power user options, etc. I thought I liked having all that in Android the 2 months I tried it, but I ended up missing Windows Phone hardcore. So I decided to grab the 1520 because it was ridiculously big, and it has my favorite OS on it, Windows Phone 8. With Windows Phone 8.1 only a few months away, I got more and more excited to be back on it. I also grabbed the Lumia 2520 tablet for $99, so at ATT I got the 1520 and 2520 for the same price of a Note 3, now that's a deal! The phone is....AWESOME. The screen is massive with great viewing angles, speakers loud, best build quality out there, and MASSIVE. Everyone always laughs when they see it because it's so giant, but I happen to love the size. Having the extra column for live tiles makes the start screen way more fun to use. The camera isn't as impressive as the 1020 was, but it's close. I've managed to get some great shots. I gave it 4 stars for Windows Phone and it's crawl to catch up. I've given up chromecast for xbox in an attempt to keep myself within the Microsoft sandbox. I'm a Windows 8.1 user, so it's not THAT hard, but it was nice that Android was pretty much compatible with anything, had ALL the apps, etc... I don't know what WP can do to get to that level, but they need to do something. I'll never leave WP again because I'm just used to it and love it. I love how fast it is to get the stuff you want, the search button rules, and the OS looks awesome, but I hope 8.1 is a big update with features we are missing the most. For the love of god, Google and MS need to kiss and make up so WP users can use google stuff without it sucking terribly.",

You can have 5 different apps open and all of them will load very quickly with almost no lag in performance. I assume this is the quad core snapdragon processor in action. The camera is pretty advanced, with many configurable settings which I don't even begin to understand, but it takes great pictures on the default setting, and being able to view and edit them on the full HD 6\" screen is a pleasure. The live tiles make a lot more sense with all the available screen real estate on this phone. I have about 30 tiles on the main page which I scroll through to get quick updates from every app. The best part about this phone is the battery. I used this phone all night, went to sleep without plugging it in, and when I woke up in the morning, it still had 50% charge left! Since the phone is microsoft, integration with Office and Xbox live is seamless. Setting up your outlook email will be a snap. Gone are the old days of no having any support from the major apps. The new windows phone has instagram, vine, waze, snapchat, google maps and most of the other secondary apps people love. You still may miss out on random third party apps and games, but you won't miss those much given all the apps available and how great they run. You can stream movies and videos in full HD anywhere you go with this phone. Unlike most phones, you can also insert a micro-sd card for additional storage. Cons: You will definitely get the stares and jeers from friends making the exact same joke \"HOW BIG IS THAT THING?\" but with the huge screen and amazing performance, you will care less. The phone fits fine in my jeans or pants pockets, although women or skinny-jean wearers probably won't agree. It takes forever to charge this thing, but the battery lasts so long that this isn't an issue. Making phone calls while holding this thing up to your ear is a little awkward, but I don't make too many phone calls and I use bluetooth in my car and office anyway. I've only had the phone for 3 days so I haven't discovered all of its features and pitfalls yet, but it's off to a superb start!",

            "body": "This is not a review for the Windows Phone operating system. Just for the Lumia 1520 phone and to a lesser extent AT&T service. I'm not going to talk about the WP OS because I am pretty biased. WP OS is leaps and bounds better than its competition. The only real negative is the lack of available apps when compared to Android or iOS. Which isn't the operating systems fault. So if you are looking at this phone wondering if the windows phone OS is good... it is. But, make sure the apps you want are available before choosing. Now for the review. Going to knock out the AT&T part first. I left AT&T a year or so ago because it was way too expensive. Even with a contract I was paying close to $100 a month for lowest possible talk and unlimited texting with 2 gb of data, on a solo contract. I came back when I bought this phone because they have done a great job revising their available plans. For instance, instead of having to add $20 for the texting, it is just there. I am currently on month to month no-contract with 1 gb of data and unlimited talk/text. I did have to buy my own phone but that doesn't bother me. I only pay around $50 a month now and it is great to not be subjected to a long contract. Throughout all my time with AT&T the service has been absolutely great as well. Which is important to me since I live a very remote area and other carrier service is just non-existent out here. I have had a few smaller ones and Verizon and AT&T by far has the best service for me. I highly recommend AT&T in its current form to anyone looking for a carrier. As for the 1520... my first impression was... wow... this thing is huge! My previous phone was an HTC 8X, which is also nice, but the 1520 absolutely dwarfs the 8X. The HD 6 inch screen is totally amazing to look at. I have always had pretty top of the line phones so am used to a good looking screen, but this one blows me away. The size and view alone is enough for me to give this 5 stars. When I see other phones now, I wonder how people use such small devices! The sound is also great, even at half volume or less it is crystal clear and easy to listen to. It gets really loud too, sometimes at work I forget I had my ringer at max and it goes off... startles the entire office, which is not a quiet office... I do have one problem with the call sound, which I'll get to later. The camera is also great. Short of getting the Lumia 1020(Or maybe the Icon, haven't looked at it much), you will not find a better camera. Nokia camera technology in phones is just unbeatable at the moment as it is and this is the second best packed into a beast of a phone. In addition to the video/picture quality, if you record a lot of video with sound, you'll be amazed how clear and clean it records. Even in loud concerts and such it will sound pretty good, instant youtube upload quality even. With all that said, this is an amazing phone, but I do have a few qualms with it that you should know about when purchasing. First and worst. There is a common problem where if you plug headphones in it will make regular phone calls sound not work. It happened to me. I have to either have headphones plugged in or speaker turned on to hear on phone calls. This would be huge to some, but doesn't matter to me since I hardly ever talk on the phone. I would also imagine this is covered under the manufacturer's warranty so if it happens to you, you'd probably easily get it replaced. Second problem I had is with the touch sensitivity. There are different settings so I have managed to change some stuff and make it feel better, but I still have problems sometimes when I go to scroll or something, instead it registers a tap. This could just be me though... and still is easy to get used to and forget about. And third... this is all me probably, the screen is supposedly gorilla glass and practically un scratchable... yet I somehow managed to get a scratch on it! You probably don't need to worry about that though... I just have that kind of luck! So in summary, even with the few little problems that MIGHT occur, this is an absolutely stunning phone and still deserves 5 stars. I honestly don't think I could even return to a smaller phone at this point if I wanted to get something else... and since I am a WP fan and do not plan to get an Android anytime soon, this is THE phone for me. Hope this review helps you decide if it is also the phone for you!",

            "body": "I switched from an iPhone to a lumia 920 a few months ago because it was too soon for an upgrade but my iPhone broke. I quickly came to like the Windows format, although most of my features were several years outdated because I couldn't get the updates to work properly. About a week ago my upgrade was finally ready and I switched up to the 1520. There are probably a lot of apps that heavy app users like that aren't available, but I haven't found a single one that I wanted that I wasn't able to find. Myfitnesspal, hulu, netflix, amazon, Pandora, iheartradio, all of my favorites are there! The system is lightening fast, I haven't had it freeze up on me a single time and everything responds as soon as you touch it. The screen clarity and quality are phenomenal for watching tv. Texting and phone calls (since it is a phone lol) have been a breeze and I really like all the little customizable options that are available. The only problem I've had at all with the phone is that this phone is definitely meant to operate and be used like a mini tablet. I'm used to being able to text with one hand and that can be difficult just because of the sheer size of this phone. I wouldn't change anything about it though so I've just gotten used to either stretching my hand out to reach the other side or using two hands to text. Not one second of regret so far, love it!",

The OS has come a long way. App store has all the apps I need. If you use a PC, you'll love the integration and ability to do light work on office documents. XBOX integration is also nice. The HD display is mesmerizing... Oh yeah, the memory is expandable. That's a big deal for me. As long as I don't drop it out of a 3rd story window, it has the stones to be relevant for quite a while.",

They update and update but still look boring with little interaction. Very simplistic. The 1520 Lumia WP destroys those boring phones. I bought this phone because I own a XBOX One and a PC with Windows 8.1 (which I love with 3 monitors, one being a touch screen). The integration and sync is flawless and Xbox live, glass just make this phone even better. I would never go back to an Android/Google product nor would I ever consider buying a personal Apple phone. MS is ahead of their times with live tiles and I think people are starting to catch on. I even cut the cord on Google's search engine and begun suing BING just because I can!",

            "body": "I've had a Nokia 1520 for about 18 months. I loved it at first. I had used an HTC Titan prior to the Nokia and it was awful, so the Nokia was a very nice upgrade. I started noticing after a few months however that it would switch screens without my fingers anywhere near it. Then, while playing songs off my playlist, it would switch songs while still playing and then jump around my playlist erratically. Then...I dropped it. The screen cracked, absolutely my fault. Then, it started dialing phone numbers without any help from me. This phone jumps around different apps without my doing anything. Through insurance, I got another new Nokia 1520. SAME THING. My current Nokia 1520 I've had now for 6 months. I haven't dropped it, nor abused it in any way. It jumps around more than my previous one. Now, while my dialing history is up, it will just pick a number in the history and dial it. While on the main screen, it jumps to my pictures and then will pick a picture and bring it up...on it's own. I'm willing to bet I'm not the only one that has this issue with the Nokia 1520, since I've had two of them, and they both exhibit the same glitch. I'm done. Switch to the LG and switching to Android.",

            "body": "I have this phone for about half year now, and replaced the phone a month ago, still two nokia 1520 showed identical problems: 1. frequently non-responsive screen (a few times every day), more often it is in non-responsive mode. for example, someone calls me and I hit \"Answer\" button, nothing happens. 2. some times, non-stop flashing screen, texts on the screen will flash up and down, non-stop. Not sure what triggers it, it can happens even when I put down the phone on desk. 3. some programs (noticeable Cortana and Bing) automatically open without any touch event, and jump between different programs. the phone is an evidence that there is no quality from either Microsoft or Nokia. No wonder they are dying. [previous review] I upgraded this phone from Lumia 520, mainly to use it as GPS and ebook reader, instead of carrying another device for reading. It is a good ebook reader and I have no trouble reading regular PDF files (using OneReader). The build felt solid, screen is very clear. However, there are a few hassles: 1. Sometimes the screen is not responsive to touch or swipe. This happens on daily basis. I have to push power button twice, then enter PIN again; Screen flashing is another issue: texts on screen move up & down a little bit rapidly as if they could not find a stable state to display them. 2. Some programs may open itself without touch: Bing search did this a few times as well as a couple of others. originally, I thought i might accidentally touch the screen, then I found it is not the case. when I put the phone on desk, I could see app opening. I have not noticed above issues on Lumia 520. so they seem hardware related. I had a high expectation for this phone tablet. after half month of usage, it is a little bit disappointment.",

            "body": "Let me start by saying I have been an iPhone user/lover/supporter since day one, and there are definitely many positives to be said for the phone and the OS, but let's face it, it's a bit boring, mainly due to it's simplicity, which is what most people seem to love about it. This is also NOT a review of Windows Phone 8, that is something you either love or hate, and has absolutely nothing to do with this phone, since if you hate the OS, you obviously do not buy a Windows Phone. This is what bothers me about some of the negative reviews here, they are negative about customer service or because they were less than thrilled with Windows Phone OS, but that is not a review of the Lumia 1520. SO I am going to make the assumption that whoever is buying this phone has done a bit of research (I know, a rather large assumption but I'll fly with it for now), and actually wants a Windows phone. Now, why I made the switch and why I am absolutely LOVING this Lumia 1520: 1. The screen is absolutely hands down the nicest, clearest, brightest screen I have ever seen on any device, be it tablet, computer, or phone. Of course it is also 6\", which is going to be a bit large for some people, but again, just like the OS, if you wanted a small phone, order a small phone. In my case I wanted the larger screen as it definitely lessens the need to carry my tablet around in many cases, and I can do things on this device that were oure torture on a 4.5\" or similar size screen. 2. The camera, although not the 41 MP of the 1020, is quite impressive regardless at 20 MP, and the software that Nokia provides make the whole camera interface 2nd to none in my opinion. There is a bit of a learning curve if you are used to just pointing and shooting, which you can still do but not to optimal effect as you can if you take control. I look forward to taking a lot of pictures and doing a lot of experimenting. 3. Did I say the screen was unbelievable? 4. Although I stated this would not be a review of Windows Phone OS, I feel I should mention that the Amber update really adds to the OS in general, and I personally like the live tiles and the customizable nature of the whole system. So, all in all if you are looking for a large screen smartphone, and are either comfortable with or willing to try Windows Phone OS, than I can very highly recommend this phone, and as you can see by the many other positive reviews many out there would agree.",

Pros: Breathtaking display If you have big hands, which I do, the phone feels great and fits perfectly. Great for intense games and apps Brilliant sound and equalizers. (Coming from having an 8x which comes with Beats Audio, this phone comes with noticeably better sound, Dolby Digital, and preset equalizers to fit your personal liking.) Fast, fluid and easy to use Amazing camera and camera app Great battery life, (over 16hrs of moderate use) Micro SD support + Xbox Music and Video Hub (Do not need my 120g Zune anymore) Windows Phone 8 is a fast and easy to use OS. The app store has all you need without a million repetitive apps. The OS just works and never stalls or freezes. I find it not too limited like the iPhone, but not as cumbersome and overwhelming as Android. If you are thinking about switching OS: All three are great and have their strengths and opportunities. I personally found WP8 to fit my lifestyle and what I need the best. I don't really see myself ever going back to iPhone or Android. This is OS is truly magnificent. Cons Definitely get a case, they phone is big and a bit slippery on the hand. Battery takes a while to fully charger. On average a good 5-6 hrs. Keyboard seems to double input some keys when I touch them. Not sure if it'll get better with more usage, but it only happens every so often. Size might be too big for some users. Even with my smaller 8X I used two hands. One to hold the phone and one to input. So it might not be an issue of you are used to using two hands.",

            "body": "This phone is fast, stable and the sreen is amazing. I had owned Iphones (up to 5s) and Android phones ( up to the samsung note 3) but this Nokia phone is better, it's simple to use, live tiles is good ,very fast and hasn't stalled yet even though I have a lot of things going on at a time not like androids phones that is fast when it's new but as you install more apps the phones slow down and crash most of the time. It is a big phone but after a while you'll get use to it and appreciate the real state but definately a 2 hand operation phone most of the time. I can never go back to smaller screen again, It's funny how Iphone said they never go bigger than 4.5\" but recently there's rumor that the next Iphone is going to be 4.7\" - 5.7\". I bought a belt holster carrier case for it and it helps rather than put it inside my jeans pocket which by the way it fits but I prefer it outside. Camera is very good beats my wifes Samsung note 3 (she's jealous :) ). Some apps is missing but there always the equivalent available and the available apps are getting more and more. Nokia included apps are great, you can download maps for offline use for gps. One of the biggest important surprise I found out was that while connected to car bluetooth stereo I can have the phone read the incoming text thru the car speaker and reply or call the person by voice command without looking at the phone or taking my hands off the steering wheel the whole time. I tried that function with Samsung Note 3 and it's not the same, while the samsung will let you answer incoming call by voice command, the voice only comes out on the phone speaker even connected thru bluetooth also for text messages it only will make a sound when a text comes in but it wont give you an option to read out the incoming text you nor reply to it by voice command so if you really have to find out out who text you and read a text you have to pick up the phone and operate it while driving which is not safe and advisable.",

            "title_review": "Switched from iphone and love it",
            "body": "I have been using an iPhone since they were first released. I have been considering the switch to a Nokia phone for some time (camera the driver) and actually tried the Lumia 1020 for a week before returning it. I couldn't stand the odd weight and balance of the lens. I've had the 1520 for nearly a month and I am as excited about it as I was when I got my first iPhone. It's hard to describe, but the feel of this phone is just right. The weight is well balanced. It fits in my front pocket surprisingly comfortably and is just awesome in my car as I can see it so well. It is easier to find music on the phone than on my Car's navigation screen, and candidly I can see the Lumia screen better than the car's so I think it's actually safer as long as your not texting. I actually only use the Lumia's navigation now as it is way clearer and simpler than the Lexus Nav I paid $2k for in my car. The camera is great and is the primary reason why I wanted to move to Nokia. I have not been disappointed. The system is really fast, far faster than the 1020, and I love the screen. It is simply easy to see. Period. Since I use my smart phone now more for the smart part and less for the phone part I honestly rarely hold it up to my head. If there is a problem that would be it, but it's so not an issue for me as it's 5% or less of the time I use this. Candidly, after using iOS for 5 years, I really like the Windows phone. Far more than I thought I would. As for apps, it simply hasn't been an issue. I travel a ton and United just put out their app so the only one I was really missing is there. I would suggest checking the apps you use, but my guess is 90% or more of what you actually use is now on windows. In my case it was nearly 100%. In summary I'm a big fan.",

            "title_review": "The 1520 is a fully functional piece of ART!",
            "body": "Things I like about it: - DAT SCREEN THO! People talk and talk about how awesome it is, but you literally cannot describe it with words well enough. - Viewing angles are also unbelievable. If you turn the screen until you can barely see the glass, you can still see everything on it! It looks just like a photograph! - They clearly knew they were designing a device that is \"too big,\" and they made some compensations to help that. Buttons pop out just enough to use them and no more to keep the device sleek but fully functional. The size allows for bigger buttons, but also plenty of room between them so that you can grip the phone without hitting them. - I like the fact that they left some space to either side of the 3 bottom buttons. Perfect for holding the phone by the corner with your thumb(s) while you're reading without hitting the back or search button. - The native programs seem to have been designed with BIG in mind as well. For example, when you are in a call, all of the buttons are dropped to the bottom third of the screen so that you can reach them with your fingers. - LOVE the glance screen. I have it on all the time which is perfect for my OCD time-checking tendencies, and I haven't noticed any extra drain on the battery. - Battery life is fantastic. I've been able to get solid 2 days out of it with no problem, including a lot of txting/browsing and light gaming. - The pre-installed apps are very nice! It's nice to get a phone out of the box and it handle 75% of what I'll regularly be doing - Speakers are VERY loud and clear!! Played some punk and some techno; both came through fantastically! - On the topic of music, Mix Radio is really nice to have! I was blown away by how many selections they had for some genres. - Love the fact that I can individually access my voicemails by clicking on them instead of having to log into voicemail and wait through the digital announcer. - VERY happy to be able to access my files on this phone through a regular windows explorer window. Things that are so-so: - There seems to be a small issue w/touch sensitivity that some people are experiencing, but that may be fixable through software. - Phone calls are fine. That's about it. They are clear, but could be louder. Definitely seems to be better quality than my Titan though. Things I'm not too happy about: - Every review mentions the pointy corners; I now know why. I thought they were being nitpicky about it, but they do seem to get annoying when trying to walk around w/the device. I can definitely fit it into my pants pockets, but you have to position it a certain way while driving, else you get jabbed every time you hit the brakes. - I don't like the mini USB at the bottom, or maybe how it's cut. I realize that it's probably the best place to put it, but when I'm holding the phone, my pinky naturally lays right on the port to balance the phone, and if I'm holding the phone for any period of time, it tends to be pretty cutty/uncomfortable.",

            "title_review": "My Road to the Lumia 1520",
            "body": "[...] The Nokia Lumia 1520 AWESOME! Full disclosure: I have been using Windows based smartphones since 2006. I started with the Cingular 2125 (Windows Mobile 5.0), then the ATT Tilt(8525)(Windows Mobile 6.0), then ATT Tilt 2(8925)(Windows Mobile 6.5), then HTC Titan(Windows PHONE 7.5), then Lumia 1020(Windows Phone 8) and now Lumia 1520 ( Windows Phone 8). I\u00a1\u00afm an enthusiast! So the Titan was my first Windows PHONE device since Microsoft changed the OS. I skipped the first generation Windows Phones. Honestly the live tiles didn\u00a1\u00aft appeal to me (at first, my how things changed). I was accustomed to hacking, loading, changing (abusing :-)) my previous phones with the Windows Mobile OS since it was open, and the look and file management of a PC-like interface really appealed to me then. In 2011 I started looking for a new phone. My contract was ended, ATT was courting me with deals to renew my contract. But I needed to do my research. A smartphone is a 2 year investment. You have to like what you get. So there were some hot devices in the market and (coming to market) as I discovered through my research. Forgive me for what I\u00a1\u00afm about to say but, the Samsung\u00a1\u00afs Galaxy S2 with its bright colors, and big clear display, caught my eye. Remember I was RESEARCHING and currently using the 3.5\u00a1\u00e5 screen, slide-out keyboard equipped Tilt 2. (Note I had previously subscribed to the desire to ALWAYS have a phone with a keyboard since I used it to write.) Anyway a couple of other phones came into view, the massive 4.7\u00a1\u00e5 HTC Titan was one. Now remember, phones had not yet gone huge. So this baby was big. Go ahead. Search the web for some of the old reviews and ads. You\u00a1\u00afll see. But wait a minute. Though the S2 had drifted from view, Samsung wouldn\u00a1\u00aft leave me alone. They went and one-upped HTC and started tempting me with the 5.3\u00a1\u00e5 Galaxy Note. 5.3 INCHES. FIVE-POINT-THREE INCHES! That was HUGE. And it had a pen, and could do all this cutting and pasting and drawing stuff with that pen. Dilemma, Dilemma, Dilemma. I thought about it. Two big phones. The note was launching in the US little later. Reviewers weren\u00a1\u00aft sure who the target was. It was thought by at least one I read that it was targeted for women due to its size. Maybe it would be safely tucked into a purse when not in use. I\u00a1\u00afm not a woman. But the large screen had its appeal. But I also started reading about Windows Phone and what Microsoft was doing with the OS, the deep social network integration. Live Tiles that deliver live updates. Microsoft Office integration. Xbox Games integration. The whole glance an go philosophy. And the Me tile.(Really cool, its like a command center for your phone.) Pre -Siri Voice interaction. The Hubs. PEOPLE HUB-Contacts on steroids-nicely connected and integrated with social networks. MESSAGING HUB-One place with seamless communication via text, Messager and Facebook Chat. THE PICTURES HUB-All my photos that I\u00a1\u00afve taken nicely arranged on my device AND all my Photos seamlessly integrated from Facebook and Skydrive AND my Social Network friends photos integrated as well AND a LIVE FEED of photos from social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Awesome. The Windows Phone OS created a seamless portal to the web. Though some data was online, you could view and interact with it as if it was on the device. Awesome. GAME HUB- Xbox gaming integration, achievements, Xbox Avatar. Nuff\u00a1\u00af said. MUSIC and VIDEO Hub- All my music that I load. Plus with the Music Pass I could listen to as much streaming music as I want. Watch and listen to Podcasts, etc. OFFICE HUB-Word, Excel, PowerPoint (One Note then) all in one place. Create documents and save to the device or seamlessly to Skydrive to access from anywhere, from any device later. BING- And that awesome Bing button that gives you quick built in options for doing Shazaam Style music identification, various forms of optical scanning(barcode, book cover, language translation, etc). LOCAL SCOUT- Suggestions based upon my location for places to eat and things to do.(Note some of the finer points I discovered in use though most of this I discovered via research). So after all this I set my eyes on the HTC Titan, with its 4.7\u00a1\u00e5 display 8 megapixel csmera and shipping with Windows Phone 7.5(Mango) and its 500 modifications to the Windows Phone OS. I got it. It was BIG. I was happy. Maybe a couple of months later the Titan 2 came out with a 16 megapixel camera. Really HTC? We won\u00a1\u00aft go there. But we will go here. Windows Phone 8 was announced. \u00a1\u00b0Hope I can upgrade, hope I can upgrade, hope I can upgrade.\u00a1\u00b1 Microsoft: Windows Phone 7.5 devices won\u00a1\u00aft be able to upgrade to Windows Phone 8. \u00a1\u00b0Bummer.\u00a1\u00b1 Microsoft: But you can get Windows Phone 7.8 with the new Start Screen. \u00a1\u00b0I love the Start Screen with the resizable tiles. COOL!\u00a1\u00b1 Months pass. More months pass. Turns out HTC passed on providing the 7.8 upgrade. \u00a1\u00b0Bummer.\u00a1\u00b1 Nokia. They were doing great things. Getting great exclusive apps to the platform. Building awesome phones. Camera technology was, (excuse my slang), off the hook. I bought my wife the 920 for Christmas 2012. I wanted one. I was still in contract with my Titan. (Which I still liked by the way). Started hearing some rumors(I\u00a1\u00afm a tech head, I follow tech news). I liked my big screen and hoped Nokia would make a big screen device. Heard and read some rumors of that possibly happening. But something else happened first. They went big another way. 41 megapixels big. Early August 2013 so did I. I got the Nokia Lumia 1020. I LOVE THIS PHONE(Hold on I haven\u00a1\u00aft forgotten this is a 1520 review). Awesome photos, great Amoled clear black display. Did I mention AWESOME PHOTOS? Oh yeah, I did. Anyway I bought this device after yearning for Windows Phone 8, and liking what the reviews were showing about the camera. I fancy myself an amateur, amateur mobile photographer. The 1020 is a great tool. All that said. It had not satiated my desire for a large screen device. The 1020 at 4.5\u00a1\u00e5 was .2\u00a1\u00e5 smaller than my Titan. There were rumors if a 6\u00a1\u00e5 Lumia. I saw pictures of part of it via the rumor mill on the web. It was HUGE. I wanted it. I read about it. Followed its development. Noted its entry in the market. And then I SAW IT. I was in an ATT store. It wasn\u00a1\u00aft supposed to be available for a week or so. So when I looked over to the Windows Phone section and saw this BIG SCREEN device that towered over all of the other devices on the display I was drawn in. It was \u00a1\u00b0it\u00a1\u00b1. The Nokia Lumia 1520 in black. I picked it up. \u00a1\u00b0HOLY COW\u00a1\u00b1 this thing was light. And THIN! The matte finish was smoothe, the edges were tapered. This smoothe black slate, was SURPRISINGLY sleek. Svelte. I turned it on. The 1080p HD screen was absolutely beautiful. The additional rolls of tiles on the large display did more for the home screen than I thought it could do. Its hard to put into words. But it seems to optimize the Windows Phone experience and OS. It looks like that\u00a1\u00afs the arrangement WP was meant for. You have to see it. Then I opened Word. I Write. Word on the large display and the large keys was, beautiful. If I wasn\u00a1\u00aft sold before I was sold now. I needed(well actually I need food, clothes and shelter. And air. I need air). I wanted this phone. Microsoft\u00a1\u00afs 12 days of deals before Christmas 2013. The first 20 customers at the Microsoft store get the 1520 free on contract. I follow the tech rumor mill, I saw the leak. I had a heads up about a week or so ahead. But how did it work? Did I have to camp out? Drive all the way there then find that the first 20 in line got the deal? I wasn\u00a1\u00aft camping out. I didn\u00a1\u00aft want it THAT bad. So the day of the deal, I called the store, (paraphrased) \u00a1\u00b0Hi do you have any more 1520\u00a1\u00e4s available under the free on contract deal.\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0No\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0Bummer\u00a1\u00b1 Guess I wasn\u00a1\u00aft getting the 1520. Then I remembered. There\u00a1\u00afs another Microsoft store in my area. I called them.(paraprased) \u00a1\u00b0Hi do you have any more 1520\u00a1\u00e4s available under the free on contract deal?\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0Yes\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0My name is\u00a1\u00ad..I\u00a1\u00afll be right there.\u00a1\u00b1 I own the 16 gig version with expandable micro SD up to 64 GB and as I described above the build and display are awesome. Videos are beautiful. The photos I take with the 1020 and transfer to the 1520 look incredible on the 1520 HD display. The 1520\u00a1\u00e4s camera is great in it\u00a1\u00afs own right,and if I owned exclusively the 1520, I would likely be more or less satisfied with the camera. But the 1020 takes the cake with photography and I use both devices as tools. The 1520 is also great for surfing the web due to the large and beautiful display. The Home Screens setup which allows for more Tiles- AWESOME. I think Microsoft with the Live Tiles is ahead of its time. The live data dynamically updating on, flipping, colorful, customizable, live tiles, observable at a glance on a 6 inch \u00a1\u00b0portable computer\u00a1\u00b1 that I can stick in my pocket giving me weather, email, social network updates, messages, pictures etc. is like something out of sci-fiction. IOS and Android(even with widgets) seem dull in comparison. - You really have to see it. Play around with it in the store, arrange the tile as you would like to see them if it was your device to get a feel. Yes I think Microsoft is ahead of the time with Windows Phones 8 live tiles. And on this device they really shine. If you\u00a1\u00afve never tried it, its different than iOS and Android but when you learn the OS, which is a cinch, WOW, its AWESOME! Also you often hear Window Phone doesn\u00a1\u00aft have a notification center like iOS and Android , and though there is no comprehensive centralized notification center as found on Android and iOS, as I mentioned Live Tiles provide updated info and notifications, but also the \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 Tile which is like your command center on Windows Phone and displays your image it also brings notifications to the surface by providing alerts/notifications from the OS level integrated Social networks of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn by displaying notifications on the live \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 tile itself allowing you to see those at a glance. But the \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 tile takes things further allowing you to see your (Facebook, Twitter LinkedIn) notifications by clicking the \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 tile, and swiping left you reach the NOTIFICATIONS page and can view all of your Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn notifications(mentions, likes, comments, retweets, LinkedIn requests, etc.) located in that one centralized location/center. So Windows Phone DOES have a notification center just not as comprehensive as the one coming in the Windows Phone 8.1 update this Spring or that found on the two leading platforms. But to fail to communicate that there is a degree of centralized notification accessible on WP and leave an impression that such functionality is completely absent from the platform would not fairly communicate the scope of what one DOES get with the 1520 or any Windows Phone 8 device. \u00a8C It probably doesn\u00a1\u00aft need to be mentioned that gaming on such a great screen is simply awesome. But I\u00a1\u00afll say it. It\u00a1\u00afs simply awesome. Now the Windows Phone OS has never needed bleeding edge specs because the OS is optimized for running on low spec hardware. Windows Phone even on low end devices is smooth, fast and zippy. So adding a quad core chip with 2 gigs of RAM adds a tad more zip,and enables the device to handle more intensive programs like graphics intensive games. Mostly because the OS didn\u00a1\u00aft really NEED high specs(though again there are some noticeable improvement) it future proofs the device for requirements that may be dictated by later upgrades to the OS and it puts it on par spec for spec with many Android devices on the market (which DO need high specs to run as smooth as WP). Bragging rights. So, yeah and this thing is FAST. It has the latest cutting edge hardware. And if you didnt know Windows Phone is a \u00a1\u00b0light\u00a1\u00b1 OS and is designed to run buttery smooth on low and midrange hardware -which it does! Unlike Android, which (until Kit Kat which is on less than 5% Android devices) requires high end specs to run smoothly and still stutters and hangs, Windows Phone is swift and smooth and on the 1520 with its quad-core innards and 2gigs of RAM, an OS which ran great on less, is like a race car with nitro on the 1520. The other functions like \u00a1\u00b0ROOMs\u00a1\u00b1 which allow you to have a private chat room experience with other WP8 users, which I use with my family and wife is AWESOME. The \u00a1\u00b0SHARED NOTE\u00a1\u00b1 aspect is VERY useful when grocery shopping with my wife, we split up and using a shared shopping list which we can update and sync as we get or add items is super handy and efficient. It cuts grocery shopping time down DRAMATICALLY! The \u00a1\u00b0SHARED CALENDAR\u00a1\u00b1 helps to keep the family on top of events. I have to say this ROOM functionality, using CHAT and the SHARED NOTE and CALENDAR was an AWESOME tool for my family and I as we planned my mother in laws surprise 60th birthday party! Now I don\u00a1\u00aft have kids yet, but sis-in-laws do. Kid Zone is an understated little miracle on WP. It allows you to create a separate profile for your little one to play around with only games and apps YOU specify. Yep, all of your stuff and settings are locked away safely behind your profile. The only cons I have is that as a phablet(I don\u00a1\u00aft like this word) the OS should have a couple of tweaks to utilize the extra screen real estate. Multiple apps simultaneously on screen. It is a \u00a1\u00b0Windows\u00a1\u00b1 Phone. A pen would be cool too. Even my Windows Mobile devices of old had handwriting recognition. Some modernizing of that application(digitizer) would be nice. Come on don\u00a1\u00aft get mad, everything can get better. :-) The phone is a delight. Its fun. Its useful. Its Awesome. All said I love the 1520 and I highly recommend it. Go get one now",

I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a phablet that can take great pictures and help you get things done. The issue here is that AT&T cannibalized this phone. If you planned to take advantage of the built in wireless charging that Nokia built into the 1520 you will be disappointed as that feature has been completely stripped at AT&T's request. Instead of Qi charging which is what all other Nokia phones and accessories use this phone uses duracells powermat charging. The technologies are separate and not compatible with one another. If you wanted the JBL power speakers which go great with Lumia phones, this isn't your device. Instead, I recommend you purchase an unlocked version of this phone from another GSM carrier and bring it to AT&T that way.",

            "body": "All my smartphone experience has been with iphone since 3g. So about 4+ years of just using Apple. I got tired of the small screen and Apple's reluctance to really catch up to the other phones that have begun surpassing it. I knew there would be difficulties adjusting to a new style of phone, but I loved the screen and loved the idea of a high caliber phone camera (really getting into phone photography in the last few months), so I decided to go with the Lumia 1520. The screen is big and gorgeous. I feel the size of the phone is a great fit in my hand. The battery life is AMAZING. The camera is excellent BUT there are a few things that really temper my initial elation with this phone. The number one WORST thing about the phone is the freakin' touchscreen sensitivity. Even turned down from High to Normal it's TOO sensitive. I'm sure it is just a software issue that can fix it but for now it's just about a deal breaker for me and the number 1 reason I wouldn't recommend this phone to others. Multiple, multiple times during use I will accidentally launch apps or open links that I was just trying to scroll past. Sometimes just touching the screen, even without lifting your finger or doing any gestures will cause whatever you are touching to launch. So annoying! I have to leave an open space on the live tile screen so I can flick over to the app menu without launching whatever app is there. The other thing that happens frequently when scrolling thru an article is that it will highlight a whole swath of text when you try to flick up. It's instantaneous too. Not like you're holding your finger on the text and then swiping up. Using 2 fingers spaced apart to scroll seems to reduce the number of times this happens but it certainly does not eliminate it. Again, I'm sure this is a software issue that hasn't been updated from the small screen to a larger screen so touch is getting misinterpreted, but until this is remedied, I definitely would not tell any of my friends to get this phone. The other main con to this phone, and it's not the phone's fault, is the terrible apps. I don't understand why MS isn't full on supporting the app store with fantastic apps to rival anyone else. I didn't realize how big the gap was between Apple and MS as far as quality apps go. It is vast. So many apps seem unrefined, like \"it's good enough\". There have only been a few that look and feel extremely polished. Disappointing, to say the least. All that said, I will be keeping my phone since I do a lot of camera photography and video/web reading and the screen is better than anyone else for doing those things, with an incredible battery life. But until the touchscreen sensitivity issue is amended I do not recommend this phone to others.",

            "body": "I've been using iPhone for several years and have been thinking to try something new and looking for alternatives. When I saw this phone on sale, I bought it and also ordered a \"3 Packs EnGive Nokia Lumia 1520 High Definition(HD) Screen Protector Flim Ultra Clear with Cleaning Cloth\"\u00a0 B00GBTNUKQ Pros: 1. One of the top hardware spec in the market , 6 inch FHD screen, powerful 4-core chips. This phone is much more powerful than nearly all other smartphones in the market, iphone 5s, Nexus 5, S4, etc. 2. Second the best smartphone camera in the market, next to the Lumia 1020, and this phone's camera reacts much faster than 1020, and it can save RAW format photo. 3. Free Office 365. 4. It has micro-SD card slot 5. The Nokia HereMap App and HereDrive can download maps (not only US but all countries) and this phone becomes a GPS even if you don't have data or signal! 6. The Nokia MixRadio (need wifi or data) is better than Apple's iRadio. 7. It has FM Radio function, but requires a headset to work. Cons: 1. The usability is bad! The system design do not effectively utilize the amazing 6 inch screen, the keyboard always occupy about 2/3 of the screen. Win 8 system setting is not as easy and simply as IOS: in IOS you can easily scroll the menu on the left and browse and select information on the right, in Win 8 you need to click into one and another manual options then exit and select another, and there are too many options. 2. There's only AT&T version in U.S, the AT&T remove the Qi Wireless charging function. 3. US Version does not come with headset (if you want to use the FM radio function, you need use your own headset) 4. The phone I have is extremely hot, not only when I play games, but also when I take pictures. The high temperature area is the corner on the right side of the camera (when you face the camera) 5. The screen of my phone has a minor color unbalance issue, about 1/3 of the screen close to the Win key has a yellow tint issue. Overall it is a good phone, and excellent phablet. It has wonderful hardware, but still has some design issue. Whether to buy it depends on your needs. There are other cool-looking phones in the market, such as MOTO X with customized color, iPhone 5s and 5c. There are some high-value hardware phones such as Nexus 5, which is fully unlocked with awesome hardware for only $350. To be honest, this phone is neither cool-looking (imagine when you hold such a huge thing to make phone call) nor very good \"bang for the buck\", but it is no double one of the two best phone-tablet so far. The other one is Note 3, which seems to have a more mature OS and better utilization of stylus pen, but the Lumia 1520 has a better camera. Overall, 3.5 stars.",

It saddens me that my first review was done in such anger and ticked off-ness. It also saddens me that in April 2015 I dropped this phone (as I had done many times since getting it) and broke the digitizer causing the touch to not work right and had to replace it with a Galaxy S6. Now I really know which phone is the \"Worst Phone Ever\" I miss my Lumia 1520 so much that I barely use My GS6.",

When she did some investigation, she discovered that this is quite a common problem. Many of these model phones are suffering from stress cracks caused by the thin case flexing and damaging the screen. So far Nokia has not stepped up to take care of their customers, so we are left in the position of paying a deductible on our damage insurance to get the phone replaced.

            "body": "I like it. It is big but I work outside and don't carry a phone while working so its great in the truck when I have down time. There's a couple pipe fitting apps I couldn't get on it that are available only througha apple. Its fast and the camera is awesome as is the screen. Switching from iPhone was easier than I expected. I'm no tech wizard be any means but I was able to handle the task in a few hrs. Good overal experience and the only reason for 4 stars was due to lack of apps and there's a few annoying update pop ups Update. You will not be able to access drop screen menus, very annoying. Ie. When you hover the cursor over an option and a screen comes down with other options, this does not work in wp8. I tried everything to contact a human about this issue with no luck. Tried to contact someone on line, no luck. So customer support is the exact opposite of apple where you can talk to an American in country about issues and get some sort of resolve. There is no forward button. You will not be able to use google chrome. You can set your browser to google but your internet shortcut button is defaulted to Bing rendering that button useless unless you like Bing. I do not. I cannot access my podcast that I listen to on my daily commute through network alone. Says I need wi-fi. Never had this issue with iPhone. I am keeping my iPhone to use as iPod so I can overcome this problem and still have my pipe fitting apps. I am keeping my 1520 because of the awesome screen and all and all i do like it slightly better than iPhone for my use as a tablet. Hulu is great and the streaming has been flawless with 1-2 bar 4g service. I just hope they get some updates to fix these simple issues that apple and Android have overcome years ago. My wife is not so happy with the 1020 for the reasons mentioned above. She could be going back to apple but she likes the 41mp camera over the 8mp camera on the iPhone 5. Update, if you had an iPhone the iPhone will steal all your text messages from people with iphones and you will not get them unless you sign out of apple and turn your imessage off on your old phone. I did this and it worked fine, my wife has been on the phone for two days (6hrs) and she still cannot receive messages from anyone with an iPhone. She is less than happy. YouTube is not very easy to use either, it makes you watch full length ads and you can't get to the content. Basically rendering YouTube useless for videos over a minute long. Update AT&T is an awful company to do business with. Go with Verizon and maybe have a little better luck. I'm keeping my phone because were stuck with att for two more years. We will be switching after that. You will not be able to receive iPhone text. Apple blames it on att, att blames it on apple. I got my phone on line just before they changed ios7 my wife got on a week later after changes were made and she's not able to receive iPhone text.They told her to contact all her iPhone contacts and tell them to delete then add her as a contact again, not something you want to do with your business contacts. I know hers is a 1020 but the OS is the same. Its a windowsphone vs iPhone thing and we are the ones that pay. The 1520 is a good phone but obviously there's some serious issues.",

            "body": "You can get a list of all the awesomeness that's the phone and display from other reviews. My serious gripe is the quality of applications. They're terrible! I ditched my iPhone 5 for this. The first thing I did was download the Amazon Kindle reader. This is big enough to be a good light weight reader. It's a D- grade application. The iOS version is A+, so why is it so bad for the Windows Phone? Amazon just threw out a crappy app to shut Win phone users up. No other reason. The app crashes all the time, you have to reinstall, download the books, 75% of books won't download, and only 10% of features that other quality apps have. I blame Microsoft for this. Did they think that developers would just come running to build quality apps? Do you think Apple just sat back and did nothing? No way! They went out and ensured that there would be quality apps for their products. Granted, there are some quality apps like Office, but from other developers this is an epic failure. Microsoft should have done more. All I'd like to do now it take it back.",

Microsoft sold me this phone for $200 with 450 minutes for $39.98 and 3GB of data for $20.. I receive phone activation email with contact number. when I called the number they told me they can not help me and I have to call Microsoft number so I called them and they told me they cannot activate the phone and I should call AT&T. I called AT&T they moved my number. I asked what kind of plan I got the rep told me 450 minutes and 3Gb of data. I tried to use my data after I left home but it didn't work. I called AT&T and they told me there is no data plan on my account. if I want 3GB I have to pay $30 they don't care what Microsoft sold me because only AT&T can say how much it cost. I had to cancel my service and return the phone. I don't have a cell phone service for 3 days now.",

            "title_review": "What a wonderful combo PHONE and TABLET works wonderfully as a LARGE phone and as mini tablet! A detailed review!",
            "body": "Just to let you know, I bought this tablet phone combo in White on Amazon as it was just what I was searching for as it is a tablet and an 100 percent GSM UNLOCKED phone! I have used and tested thoroughly and found that it does have so many overall advantages. So as a techie, I tested this phone/tablet out to great lengths and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this amazing device. *This is a excellent choice in an ALL IN ONE device. For me, I use it as my primary phone with no contract plan that includes minutes and a small data plan. (Most of the time, I am on WiFi for the internet but I need my minutes to make and receive phone calls etc). Also I want to state that the phone accepts a MICRO Sim card, not a regular full sized Sim. Since I had an old Samsung Tab 2 3g with a regular Sim, I just removed my old Sim Card from the older tablet phone and cut the Sim with a Micro Sim cutter, placed it into my Tab 3 phone/tablet and my data was there, my minutes were there, worked great! Also this tablet installed an update to the OS from December 2013 and this tablet phone runs so fast now! If you are looking for: a lightweight combo phone and tablet that is very easy to hold in one hand comfortably and you want a basic and easy to use tablet, then consider this tablet. While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies. And as a bonus, if you request it, I will share with you how to get Archived Flash so you can watch online videos on the tablet. And I encourage you to ask me questions in the comments (should you have a question) about this tablet and I will answer all questions. Here are the Pros and the Cons below. PROS: 1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is good in most places I tested. And I received a STRONG WiFi signal on this device. 2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB. 3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily. 4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port. 5- Screen clarity - For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages. 6- I had a Tab 3 7.0 WiFi only and sold it to a friend, bought this one and find that it is a much better tablet. CONS: - Low internal storage - this tablet comes with 8GB internal storage (advertised). Because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage. This is not good because when you install an app from the Playstore, it goes onto your internal storage not on the External SD card. (The external SD card is meant for personal files such as your music, photos, home movies,etc). **The GOOD NEWS IS: If you do not install a lot of huge games onto this tablet, you will probably do just fine with this storage. - Heat \u2013 Under normal conditions (when not running intense games or downloading files etc), this tablet runs very cool. It did get up to 102 degrees ONCE when I downloaded lots of apps from the Playstore, but then it went back to a low 80 degrees after that. This is normal though for this particular tablet, not a cause for any alarm. Bottom line and Summary: Would I buy this phone tablet all over again? Yes in a heartbeat! If you are looking to buy a LARGE PHONE that you can use as a MINI TABLET, this is the one that I recommend to you as I love mine! Since I am a techie, you can ask me any questions in the comments under this review.",

            "body": "At less than $50, this is value. It will access LTE data, get you around the web, provide Google's voice-prompted turn-by-turn navigation, YouTube, the voice-recognition capability of Google Now, and speak-to-type. Its specs aren't premium, but you're paying less than $50 and getting a reliable old Chevy truck that won't die, that will get you out of Dodge when the zombie apocalypse comes, will start when you need it, get you through a blizzard to the grocery store or hospital. No, this isn't the status symbol see-and-be-seen luxury ride. If you want that, then pay 10 to 20 times more. Yes, 10 to 20 times more. A Nexus 6 is $549. An iPhone 6S Plus 128GB is $949 before tax. So, no, it's not a badass Secret Service-looking black Suburban, a Hummer, a Range Rover, or Porsche Cayenne, but it will get you to the same places. It is an entry-level Android and a full-on smartphone without qualification quotes. By 2015 standards, Motorola has provided a solidly functional and capable device that will perform what a smartphone should be able to perform in 2015. This is a smartphone, no doubt about it. This is perfect for a backup phone if you're between premium phones - say, selling one top of the line phone while waiting for the release date of the next latest and greatest.",

            "body": "Great \"entry level\" phone. I use quotes because to be flat out honest, this is pretty much everything most people need in a phone. Yes, there are some folks out there who need to have the latest and greatest devices, but this one probably takes care of most 80% of smartphone users out there. The finish and backing on the phone are made out of great materials. The backing is a slight rubberized material and doesn't slide off tables or in your hand. My friend has a Motorola Nexus 6 phone which is several hundreds more than this one, and the phone is pretty similar in build and finish. The Verizon model of this phone, in particular, is great because there are some simple workarounds for those who are computer/tech savvy to get the GSM slot of this phone unlocked for use on ATT and T-Mobile. Do a quick google search on \"Moto E Verizon GSM unlock\" and that should get you started. I struggled with it a little bit, but after about 30 minutes I was able to get it unlocked and used it with Cricket Wireless. 4G LTE data was occasionally inconsistent, however. Overall a great device with screen size and form similar to that of an iPhone 5. One frustrating thing about later versions of Android is the inability for apps to read/write on to your SD card (since Kitkat, I believe). I frequently listen to podcasts using the BeyondPod app, which downloads MP3s directly to the phone now, instead of on my SD card, because of the limitations on the Android OS. Still a great phone at a tremendous value, if you can get these during occasional sales at around $40.",

            "body": "Two small things about this phone. Two things that drive me crazy. 1.) NFL mobile. SERIOUSLY? Not everyone wants to watch an overglorifed game of fetch. (To put it short,bloatware.) 2.) I bought this to use on wifi. Either I have the sim card in,and it trys to activate the phone EVERY time i turn on the phone. OR i take the sim card out,and have a lovely \"no sim found\" notification at ALL times. BUT. It is a beautiful phone with little to dislike about it. Good camera,good screen,nice sounding speaker (despite it only being mono) and above all,an amazing deal. Would recommend to anyone who needs a small & cheap smartphone with moderate hardware. *4 month update* This phone is still amazing. both of my complaints i had with this phone have now been fixed. 1) NFL mobile can be disabled in the app settings,which removes it entirely from the app menu. 2)If the sim is in,it will try to activate your phone. BUT. if you turn the phone off and on 3 or so times,it stops trying and goes away completely. HOWEVER...This phone is running the Android 5.1.....if you don't know why this is a bad thing,let me explain: Android 5.1 has an issue with ram leaking... (This means your ram gets eaten up quickly and can only be fixed by restarting the phone.) If you don't restart this phone every couple days,it gets very slow. this problem would be fixed if they updated the phones firmware to android 5.1.1 or android 6.0,but unfortunately there is no update as of today.

I have been having occasional issues with the WiFi randomly cutting out for seemingly no reason, but that's pretty much my only complaint.

Only a couple drawbacks. It has NO flash. Kind of a bummer cause that would improve the camera quality marginally. It has no notification LED. That was one of the biggest things I loved about the Moto G. I didn't have to turn it on to see if I had something waiting for me. I could just glance at it and be done. The signal is weaker now that I'm using this phone. I don't know whether that's due to the phone itself or my network area. I've tried resolving this issue multiple times but keep losing signal (ironic....). Overall a fantastic deal for the price. It runs wonderfully. A little bummed out I can't root it but that's kinda expected with something locked down to a prepaid plan such as this.",

UPDATE July 1st 2016: I have been happily using this phone as my daily driver for the past few months and it has been amazing for the price. Even though it is still running lollipop, most apps and software are still supported on the phone. There are also a few lag spikes every now and then on the phone but not too often.

It can crash sometimes because the system is slow, but the battery life is great and it's fairly easy on my data plan. I maintained pretty well off of 3-5 gigs a month. It's pretty cheap too.

            "body": "I love this phone. It is very durable, user friendly and reliable. Of course the service reliability comes from the service provider, Verizon. Sometimes now, since I have had the phone a while it will freeze up and give me some problems with slowing down and not being as sensitive to touch on the touch screen as it used to be. The little plastic lining that goes around the phone comes off really easy, with almost any knock, I am actually surprised I have not lost mine already. overall, it is an excellent phone.",

            "title_review": "Great, cheap phone for casual users! Works on T-Mobile. Good performance and durability.",
            "body": "WHY I GOT IT: I used to have a Samsung S4, but I decided to get this phone because it had the Lollipop OS, and my S4 was getting slow. I have T-Mobile and was able to easily get my SIM card working on this phone. USING T-MOBILE ON THIS PHONE: Disclaimer: I am an Android developer so perhaps, the steps were easier for me than for an average person, but it's pretty much copy and paste to get this phone working with T-Mobile. I used this link to get it working : http://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-e-2015/general/how-to-verizon-moto-e-2015-gsm-network-t3098953 PERFORMANCE I really like this phone and was surprised at its performance for such a low price point. It's actually faster than my S4. \"Ok Google\" works great and the phone quickly loads websites/images, so no complaints here. Motorola has really kept it mostly pure and there is no bloatware. There is a feature that allows you to peek at notifications from the lock screen with a long press. I find that the Moto Assistant is pretty useful and it automatically silences my phone when I'm a meeting since it knows what my Google Calendar events are. See pics for more details about Moto's additional features. CONS When I first got it, the default messaging app was tied into Verizon I think, so I downloaded Google Messenger and set that as my default SMS app. My only other gripe is the low camera quality, but that is to be expected for something that costs about $40. The pictures are more \"grainy\" compared to my S4. DURABILITY I have dropped this phone several times without a case and it is fine - no cracks or damages. OVERALL, a great,cheap phone for casual users that don't need high-quality pictures. This is a perfect phone for younger children or people who want a basic smartphone and don't care too much about the camera quality.",

            "body": "I bought this phone is September of 2015 for my dad who is just getting into smartphones and he loves it! The phone itself is not anything compared to $400+ phone, but for $50, it is a steal. The software is great and runs really fast. The construction is nice, solid-feeling and fairly grippy. The battery seems to last my dad all day with low to moderate use. The included micro SD card slot is also a nice addition. The only bad things I'd say about this phone is that the screen is less than 720p, which as a person who has used a 2k phone, is very poor to my eyes. Also, the camera is 5mp, which looks quite bad, but again, this is a $50 phone, so many corners will be cut to meet that sale price. Pros: Battery lasts all day Construction is great Included Micro SD card slot Cons: Poor screen resolution(>720p) Poor photo quality (5mp back; VGA front) Conclusion: This phone is great for any new phone user looking for a good phone for the cheapest price.",

            "body": "I just got this Moto E and set it up. I haven't updated to Lollipop 5.1 yet, but the update is downloaded and ready to go. It is convenient and responsive, decent screen quality, and fits my hand and pocket well. My biggest complaint with this phone is it has a somewhat grainy voice quality which is reminiscent of digital phones when they first came out. I am comparing to an 3-year-old Droid Razr Maxx and a new Samsung Note 4, both of which are much better. The speaker also has a tinny sound quality. It also does not have a flash for the camera. I am replacing an older Verizon phone on a post-paid plan. This is a pre-paid phone, but it is not locked to pre-paid. I turned it on for an initial test, then turned it off before it could start the setup. It wanted me to register for a new pre-paid plan. I popped the rear bezel off with a finger nail and removed the sim card that came with the phone. I inserted the post-paid sim from my old phone and turned the phone back on. It immediately recognized the sim and displayed my existing post-paid phone number. After I completed the setup I was able to make calls and send text messages. I noticed the download arrow in the notification area. It was downloading a lot of old apps from my other phone, so I had to immediately log onto Google Play and press \"Stop\" to stop the phone from downloading. I wish there was a way to delete apps from Google Play using a computer as using the phone is slow and tedious. Plus I have these apps on two other phones, and I may have to delete them from each phone before they go away and stop trying to download. Other than that, I'm good to go!!!",

            "title_review": "Such a good deal for the price!",
            "body": "I got this phone to try android and was very impressed with the features for the price! As an employee of Apple, I've always had iPhones, but was wanting to try an android because of boredom. This was a very cheap option with lots of features. Pros: Very strong build quality. Doesn't feel cheap like the Samsungs I've tried. The rubberized curved back made it easy to hold on to without a case. The reception seemed just as good as my iPhone's I've had. LTE was quick. The processor seemed to be on par with the iPhone 5 of a few years ago according to benchmarks, and was snappy enough for every day use. The non-cluttered version of android was nice and probably helped with performance. Still was able to load clash of clans and even real racing 3 in reasonable times. Graphics of course didn't seem on par with iPhone or more expensive android devices, but I didn't expect that. I was able to load in my SIM card from my regular contracted line with an adapter since it was a nano sim, and it activated with no issues. Cons: The reason I didn't subtract any stars for these was because it was $50! Even at the normal unlocked price at $100, it's still a good deal. Most of my complaints are OS related and not because of the phone itself. Motorola has been doing quite well at making quality devices for good prices the last couple years (see the new Moto X!). If I wasn't so invested in the Apple ecosystem, I'd probably switch. The camera quality was awful, but I expected that from a 5 mp camera with no flash. So unless there's good lighting, don't expect to be the most popular person on Instagram. The screen size was good, but it wouldn't have hurt to put a 720p screen on like the previous year's Moto G. It is very low resolution, but again, it was $50. Just don't expect HD video quality. THE MAIN ISSUE I ran into was because Android Lollipop doesn't allow you to install apps straight to the SD card. So even though you spend money on a large SD card to make up for only having 4gb available because of the OS taking up half the storage, you still end up running out of space because it can't download updates anymore if you have a lot of apps. I tried everything in moving all the apps possible to the SD, but it still downloads the updates to the main drive before transferring them. I gave up trying to have any large games on it more than 1 gb. Overall, it was a good temporary device, but I didn't keep it since it wasn't functional enough to take complete advantage of the extra storage you add.",

            "body": "While this phone can leave some to be desired if approached with the wrong attitude, it not only gets the job done but has impressed me several times. As a iPhone user since the iPhone 3, I purchased this product to essential try the Android ecosystem without breaking the bank. While the Android software is bloated down fairly heavily with this phone, especially considering the very limited internal storage size and storage management system with an SD card (only some/few apps being able to be moved to the SD card and the whole experience of moving those apps to be cumbersome and frustrating), the bloatware is not as bad as it could be. The phone starts at roughly 8 GB and with the android OS taking up 3 GB, you're left with 5 GB which sounds decent but shrinks very fast with the size of current applications and the data that they hold. That being said, this phone runs impressively smooth and certainly usable even under load of switching between several apps. The phone isn't as snappy as say the iPhone 6 (the only phone I have to compare it to) but rightfully so given the incredible price-point of the Moto E compared to a number of other phone and certainly compared to any iPhone. The buttons don't feel as insuring as the snappiness of the device, however, being somewhat loose and responsive enough to get the job done but definitely lacking a satisfying feeling when going to make a button press. The screen is by no means impressive, but it's also not disappointing. It leaves a little to be desired but is sharp enough that things are still somewhat crisp. Another important thing to note (that I wasn't aware of at the time that I purchased this device but soon found is one of the larger disappointments I had in the device) is that the Verizon pre-paid version of this phone cannot be rooted or unlocked to flash a custom ROM. While this certainly isn't a deal-breaker, especially for the people that don't have the technical skill or the ones that are not interesting in the perks of rooting or flashing, being able to root or unlock the phone would add to the value tremendously as it could eliminate the small drawbacks that I did find I had including the storage management, bloatware, and few other odd twerks with settings. The Verizon pre-paid version is one of the only versions of this phone that is carrier locked by my understanding and isn't unlock-able so some research and possibly look into the Sprint or other model/versions of this phone is advised if you wish to take advantage of those things. With all things considered, especially including the absolute steal of a price, this phone is pretty superb for its bracket. It definitely isn't a flagship, but it wasn't designed to be and with that in mind, it is certainly impressive and exceeds expectations in several aspects.",

I have had it two months and it is the slowest smart phone I've ever owned. Today I've had to restart it 4 times because my keyboard keeps disappearing and will not pop up when I need it to type a text. I recommend buying the Moto G instead and I will be purchasing a Moto G as soon as possible.",

            "body": "I picked up this phone for $44.99, which is insanely cheap for a decent Android phone off-contract. The description says that the phone is Verizon pre-paid only-- but that's not true! I put my post-paid SIM card in the phone before turning the phone on for the first time, and it worked without any issues. I bought this phone as a replacement for my current device (this was $100 cheaper than paying for a replacement phone through Assurion). I would recommend this phone for anyone who needs a replacement phone to get them by for a few months until their contract is up for renewal. It's not a top-end phone by any means, but it works well and I'm not missing my old HTC One Max (a phone with far superior hardware). This phone is also running Android 5.0 out-of-the-box. For this price, you're not going to find a better phone-- whether this is a replacement OR your primary phone. [Additionally, you can find ways to use this phone with other carriers (like T-Mobile, ATT, Sprint, etc.) on the XDA-Developers forum. You have to do a little bit of work, but it's definitely worth for the versatility of being able to drop in a SIM card from any carrier.]",

Note THIS CAN BE USED ON VERIZON CONTRACT LINES.....BEFORE YPU TURN ON FOR FIRST TIME SIMPLY PUT YOUR DIM CARD IN PHONE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT SAYS PHONE ALREADY ACTIVATED. I had six months to upgrade and my old lucid 2 could not keep up with new apps. This is great two updates avaliable out of box. 8 gig memory which I had 6 avaliable only a few Verizon apps. Nothing like other Verizon phones. Comes with Verizon text message app. You can get the Motorola one for free. On that point no real tool apps like memo pad or voice record . but that is good for those who don't use. On my old LG 6 apps I can not remove I never used wasted hard drive space. Again on speeker I will use for another week to see if it clears up if not I will get replacement. Love the phone heavy construction feels solid. Like a tank.",

            "body": "I have an iPhone 6 provided from my job but I like to keep my personal phone separate from work. I wanted something on Verizon prepaid and I didn't want to spend a lot. I have to say, I'm really impressed by the moto e. My last phones have been the galaxy s5, the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6. All great phones, but really, at $500-$600 new, they really ought to be. First off, its been awhile since I have experienced android and I have to say it's come a long way. If you are a heavy google user, (maps,chrome, gmail etc) it really is a no brainer to have an android phone. The apple versions of these apps work, but just not as seemlessly and effortlessly. All that aside, this is a $47 phone I'm reviewing. The fact that I use my iPhone 6 next to this and its not awful says it all. Its fast enough for regular use, it loads everything quickly , build quality is pretty standard and solid, battery lasts all day. The places this phone falls short are screen resolution and camera quality. The screen resolution is noticeable against an iPhone but I was less bothered by it than I thought I would be. The camera is probably the only reason I could see myself ever needing more phone than this. That said, if makes me feel more inclined to take pics with my real camera which blows my iPhone away, so maybe not the worst thing. All said I can't say enough about how much I like this phone at this price point. I mean, the case I bought for my iPhone cost me $10 less than this entire phone. Its liberating to know its not the end of the world if something happens to it. Last but not least, I bought a 32gig SD card ( the max the moto e can handle) and increased my storage to 40 gigs for $13. Those constant messages about my storage running low on my iPhone 6 sting just a little bit more these days. Not a perfect phone, but at $47 brand new, if this isn't 5 stars, what is?",

            "body": "This is much better than most of the prepaid phones on the market that you may want to use. I simply let it charge for only 15 minutes to look at the wifi capabilities but it might be better to not turn on the phone at all before you insert a SIM card from a BYOP tracfone program or another carrier. It is really simple if you follow the directions in the tracfone Bring Your Own Phone activation kit and you are good to go. I also did not have any problems at all and my minutes transferred from my old account to the new cell phone within fifteen minutes. Tracfone has much better prices than verizon so I would use the other SIM card kit for the phone and it is totally wrong that it has to be used on the Verizon plan. The only thing that shows now is the Verizon Wireless text in odd places but it just flashes and then goes off quickly. It does not even say \"SIM Card is missing,\" after you turn it off several times and I only disabled the Verizon App and then the SIM Card Toolkit App and it was good to go. I thought I would have to learn some kind of cell phone command language or order an unlock code, but I barely did anything but activate my new SIM card very quickly lol. Updated Review 3 Months After Purchase: For some customers, they might want to add a second user to the phone that lets you have an entire different screen and set of apps. So technically I don't think it lets you add a new user if you did not use Verizon. I have been trying for an hour to download an app on a New User account or even the guest account and it keeps saying there is a connectivity problem that is strange and also does not appear on my regular account. Even more concerning, the account for the new user and the guest also are freezing out of control and have to \"Check connection\" for five minutes every time you try to log in. Sadly this is very unusual for the phone and I believe it is because it tries to look for the Verizon account setup. I think it is overall as the original user much better than an iPhone 4s that has been used for a year for speed, screen size and overall color, and even the phone response to the touch even though I had a life proof cover on the iPhone for the entire span of it and it has never been dropped or cracked. So the original user interface is really wonderful but in comparison the option to add a new user or a guest user is hacked if you are using another network.",

            "body": "I have to say that over the last year or so, Android has finally redeemed itself in my eyes, and the reason for that mostly has to do with Motorola. The Moto G has been an unmitigated top level experience for me so far, so when I found $10 Moto E LTE (Verizon) being blown out by Best Buy during Black Friday, I picked up one. In previous years, you would have been hard pressed to recommend an Android phone for anything under $200. In fact, for my parents, I'd moved them to Lumia phones for that reason: it seemed that for anything with under 2GB of RAM, Android was really sluggish, and had miserable battery life. The Motorola Moto E with 1GB of RAM didn't seem like it would be any better, but for $10 I could have a spare phone. I'm a T-mobile user, so the first thing I did was to follow the instructions to convert the phone to GSM mode. These instructions involved turning the phone into a developer machine, and then using adb to set the wireless radios to talk to the GSM network instead. The penalty is that if you ever switch SIMs (or even pull the SIM out and reboot), the device will revert back into Verizon mode, so this isn't a phone you could expect to travel to various countries and buy local SIM cards with: you'd have to go through the unlock sequence every time you inserted a new SIM card into the device, so unless you're also bringing a laptop with adb installed and are willing to go through it every time you switch SIMs, you're better off buying a truly unlocked phone. Part of the reason Android performance on lower end devices is now acceptable is because hardware has gotten faster. The Moto E LTE has a Snapdragon 410 SoC, which is clocked just 200MHz slower than the one in the Moto G 2015. That 15% disadvantage in clock speed is noticeable, but it's the 1GB of RAM that's really what makes the phone feel less than instantly responsive to your touch. Apps startup just that bit slower, though once started, the apps feel just as fast as on the Moto G. Note, however, that app startup is something you do frequently on Android phones: you click on a link in Gmail, for instance, and startup a web browser. You'd click the share button on the web browser, and then bring up Facebook or Google+ to post. So the performance penalty for task switching really hurts if you're a power user. The camera is decent for taking pictures of receipts and in good light. But without even a flash to help, it's pretty much something you're not going to use and be delighted with. The 4.5\" screen feels like a throwback to 5 years ago: coming from the Moto G, you wonder how anyone ever thought 4.7\" was a decently sized phone, let alone 4.5\". The smaller screen does help with the performance, though: with fewer pixels to push, the device is acceptably fast most of the time. For $10, the phone is definitely a deal. It's more than acceptable, and better than any of the cheap Lumias from past years. For the full retail price of $120, I'd say the Windows Phones start looking better. Fortunately, you'd never have to pay that: the Amazon street price of the phone is around $35, and at that price, I'm think that Windows Phones aren't ever going to be taking market share from Android. The Moto E LTE is a phone that does everything that the higher end devices do acceptably, and with the full range of apps that the windows phones cannot match. I'm now convinced that even supposedly \"thin\" skins such as found on the Sony Xperia phones suck a ton of CPU/GPU power away from UI responsiveness, and that's to be avoided if at all possible, and if you manage to do so, phone hardware is now powerful enough that the Windows phones no longer have an advantage. Recommended. I have to say, if Motorola had been smart enough to make the Moto X Pure waterproof, it would now be in the running for an upgrade: that's how impressive the Moto G has been. Seriously, I have no idea why most of the flagship phones aren't waterproof. It seems like such a basic feature if even a $180 phone can achieve it!",

            "body": "Here is all the smartphone a normal person needs at a very attractive price. I've had a smartphone since the original iPhone S because I am a business user and viewing the internet on the go was a godsend. My litmus test for a phone was and still is whether it works well... its quick, has all the features, etcetera. I don't buy phones as jewelry ... they are tools. I only buy expensive tools if they make sense, and I don't see the advantage to buying an expensive phone if a lower priced phone works for my needs. Two years ago I bought one of the first android phones to reach the $100, and it was a completely different story than this Moto E. It was slow and ran out of memory all the time. It was almost unusable. I ended up replacing it quickly, but I knew the time would come where good phones would drop below that price, and apparently the time is now. Two months ago I bought this phone. Simply put, it is great. Its fast and completely usable for all of my smartphone needs. The battery lasts all day. The case is sturdy and the screen is similar to a high end phone from 2 or 3 years ago. Here is a great personal pocket computer for the price of a dinner for two. The one part of the phone I'm not satisfied with are the cameras. They're okay, but better cameras are what I'll look forward to from an upgrade in the future. For the price, I'm blown away by the value.",

            "body": "I bought this specifically to use as an MP3 player and it is GREAT. I haven't activated phone service so I can't speak to that. I have battled with an iPod Touch and iPad for six years and iTunes is so intuitive I have never figured it out. In less than 72 hours and under $70 total (Moto E, 16 gigabyte micro SD card, and $3.99 paid version of PowerAmp app) I have accomplished what I could never figure out in Appledom: I have imported three flavors of music from a Windows PC: a) iTunes purchases over the Internet; b) Ripped CDs; c) Ancient MP3 files generated from old cassette tapes I owned, using PolderBits software (that was years ago, don't know if it is still available), and organized Playlists based on the file structure from the PC. What Appledom could never never do was recognize the folder structure. So tape A was in a nice little folder with its name and songs labeled \"Track_01\" etc. Tape B was in its little folder with songs labeled \"Track_01\" etc. All the Apple's horses and all the Apple's men could never keep it straight and I always had all the \"Track_01\" jammed together, followed by all the \"Track_02,\" etc. I could manually sort it out but heaven forbid I should sync the iPod again, or update iTunes! With PowerAmp, I can scroll by folders AND THEY ARE THE WAY I ORGANIZED THEM ON THE PC! What a novel concept! Who would ever have thought a person would want the same organization on their MP3 player as on the PC! There are some odd artifacts; mainstream commercial CDs are OK for the most part, but some high school choir CDs and Pimsleur language CDs have odd embedded data which may have come from ripping with iTunes, or from somewhere else. These are all in their own files where I stored them, as near as I can tell, but in the \"folder\" view it seems I can also see them in ghost folders based on whatever is in the hidden attributes. Some of the high school songs are attributed to random commercial artists, and some Pimsleur language files are co-mingled across languages. But I still can go to the original folder from PC and EVERYTHING IS WHERE I PUT IT; the co-mingling is only in the ghost folders. Once the files are loaded, PowerAmp seems a little harder to use than the Apple player - more options, more chances to go wrong. It took me a while to get it to stick to one playlist. There are shuffle options that will jump from list to list and I'm pretty sure I don't understand all I know about it. I haven't yet figured out how to make it display which playlist I'm listening to. I hope I can, that was something I liked about the iPod. Back to the phone itself, I do notice that the cover art is not as crisp on this phone as on the iPhone, but I don't listen with my eyes. If you are buying the phone as a phone and the display is important to you, this is a step down from an expensive phone. However even with my trifocals I can read all the text I need for navigating through my music. The speaker on the phone is pretty good - better than my old iPod Touch and at least as good as my company-issued iPhone 6 - and it sounds great to me plugged into my desktop speakers. But I don't pretend to be an audiophile. I'm not saying anything bad about the sound, I'm saying I don't have the ear to tell. It is loud enough to listen to talk recordings riding around in my pocket while I do chores. I haven't tried it with headphones. The FM radio tuner is decent but it only works when something is plugged into the headphone jack; the cable is the antenna. I have played with the Internet over WiFi a little. When I'm doing one thing at a time it seems every bit as fast as the iPhone 6, on the same WiFi signal. I haven't activated the phone service so I don't know how it would be accessing the Web over a cell signal. Also I have not tried browsing the Web with other apps running in the background. After spending an hour or more organizing playlists, and playing external speakers for 7 hours and the built in speaker for another couple of hours, the battery indicator looks like it is still about 2/3 full. The first day it seemed to drain faster but after a long overnight charge it is working great.",

Only some apps install on the sd card and you have to move then to it. It has a hidden menu that you can see with network app and use this on GSM networks, But I have not tried it.

I don't want to spend a huge amount of money for a phone or have a long lasting contract. Some pros and cons Pros: cost, Lollipop 5, long battery life, stripped down Android, nice size, strong signal, 4G LTE, front facing camera that I can use with Skype, nice speed - but I'm comparing with a Galaxy S 3 Cons: locked bootloader that cannot be unlocked, unable to root (probably more a function of lollipop), no NFC, 8GB vs 16Gb of internal memory - just make sure to get an SD card and move apps to the SD card that allow for it - I have a good number of the popular apps and still have 1GB free",

            "body": "Don't waste your money with this cheap piece of junk. There's a reason Motorola is going under. Bad products, bad management, bad customer service and bad company policies. This junk almost immediately began to have problems with the microphone. At first I assumed it was something to do with my signal thinking no way something that LOOKS so nice could actually be such a piece of junk. Sure enough, after two months of seldom use the microphone finally gave out. I tried blowing it out with canned air and even doing a factory reset, but nope. Fortunately I purchased a protection plan for it when I bought it at Chinamart but all they did was give me the number for Motorola. The man in India whom I had to repeat my name five times to and still insisted my first name was really my last name told me that if I sent them $125.00 dollars they would then send me a new phone which I'd probably receive in about a month's time (being it was India) and then after I sent them my old phone back (another month) he would then reimburse me $100.00 dollars. I paid $60.00 for it at Chinamart. Don't waste your time with any product made at the soon to be out of business Motorola Corp. unless you like to contribute to some obese CEO's golden parachute. UPDATE: After finally giving in and sending the phone to get repair it was sent back but lasted about a month before issues with the battery draining and the phone boot looping began. Apparently, from what one of the salesmen at Verizon told me is that Motorola has been having problems with many of their phones batteries malfunctioning. Supposedly this issue has been cleared up with their latest models but there never was a recall on all the bad models. So I have sent the phone back a second time to be repair. Whether they fix it is another issue. Needless to say I will never buy Motorola again.",

            "body": "This is a nicely built, decently spec'd entry-level device. I decided I would try one at Best Buy, on their 14 day trial period, to see if it would make a good replacement or back-up phone for the Motorola Luge (Razr M) I've been using for the last three months on Verizon's pre-paid plan. The first thing I noticed about it was that it was MUCH more difficult to customize than the Luge was. I'm not sure if it was the new Lollipop OS, or the proprietary Moto stuff, or the pre-loaded Google Launcher, but it wouldn't correctly run any of the notification reminder apps in the play store (I have found them to be essential for not missing calls and text messages), or my beloved Moto Circles widget. In addition, they kind of force you to merge all of your email accounts into the Gmail app on this thing, and it was very hard to figure out how to keep my email accounts separate, the way I like them, and still get notifications of them as they arrive. On top of that, it doesn't come with a stock video player, forcing you to download and install a 3rd party app if you don't want to use the limited gallery app to watch videos. I was also surprised to find a 5MP camera with limited zoom ability and no auto focus, when my Razr M (a year older phone) came with an 8MP one with great zoom and auto-focus, and the front-facing camera for selfies on this thing was a joke. In keeping with all the other disappointments, even with what they call a \"1.2 GHz QUAD core processor\" in this Moto E 2nd Gen, it was no faster than my 1.5 GHz DUAL-core Razr M. In fact, my Razr M located me, drew the map and started navigation faster than the Moto E did, and everything I looked up on both devices came in just as quickly on the Razr M, or faster, than it did on the Moto E. I DID like the way Lollipop stays active with Google Now and the \"OK Google\" thing while you're on the home screen, but apparently any phone running the new Android OS does that, so this ONE better thing about this phone certainly wasn't enough to justify the $69.99 price when I only paid $49.99 for the Razr M, so I returned it within the 14 day grace period and will continue to enjoy my Motorola Luge until they come out with something considerably better around this price. This cute little Moto E was a real disappointment compared to the Luge, or my other device, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom (which I LOVE as a fantastic camera that also works pretty nicely as a phone on AT&T's MUCH poorer network). Bottom line? If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive entry-level phone and haven't fallen in love with certain things about your current phone (like the cool Circles Widget, Notification Reminders, LED notification capability, decent camera, stock video app, etc., etc., etc.) you might just find this phone to your liking, especially at this $69.99 price on Verizon's INCREDIBLE network and very reasonably priced, pre-paid plans.",

            "body": "Hardware Design; the phone feels and looks good. The textured removable edge and the matte black rear of the phone feel good to hold. A small dimple at the Motorola logo helps you to keep a good grip on the phone. This is actually one of the nicest feeling phones I have ever held, it fits in my hands well and its easy to grip one handed and touch every part of the screen. The visual aesthetics are well thought out too, there are no visible slots for sim or SD and the phone is entirely black. Its nearly symmetrical except for the power button and the volume up/dn which are both on the right side. The power button has a texture which helps you know you are pressing what you want. There are no other physical buttons.The headphone port is centered on the top of the phone. There is no text on the exterior of the device, but the Motorola, Verizon, and 4G LTE logos are all on the back. A black rubberized ring wraps the outer edge of the phone, you can snap this off to reveal the micro SD card slot, the SIM card slot and the tag that is on a little pull label (this was seriously unexpected and kind of fun). The battery is non-removable. It charges via micro USB. Battery: I dont use the phone that much, but I go through maybe 40-50% in a day. Unless you are using it constantly, it should last most people a full day. Camera: Barely useable. Works fine outside on a sunny day, but indoors you get very grainy blurry photos. It doesn't focus very well. Selfie-cam, forget it. If the back facing camera is bad, the front one is terrible. OS and Software: The OS is Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. It's not as good as Jelly Bean or Kit Kat but because this is a Motorola phone you can hope that updates will come quickly. Motorola and Verizon have some bloatware, but its not acceptable. Verizon Messages is surprisingly good. Comes with an FM radio app. All email now goes through Gmail; which takes some getting used to. The Camera and Gallery apps are as bad as the hardware. Seriously, if you need a proper camera phone, this is not for you. For under $100 unlocked, this is a good deal, its likely that it will hold its value for quite a while on the second hand market.",

If you're like me and are a deep sleeper, this alarm will auto-snooze for you. I've almost missed a few very important events because of this phone.

            "body": "I also bought one of these from a Verizon storefront with a prepay service, and it's a piece of junk. The phone has serious problems: 1. Twice, I had trouble getting the phone to answer a call, and when the audio finally connected, it was at earsplitting volume. Because both these occurred while answering, it was annoying enough that I don't exactly remember the sequence. I refuse to experiment to pin down the sequence that would allow me to reproduce the problem because I refuse to risk damage to my hearing. My ears are still buzzing from the last time, and will go to the doctor if it doesn't clear soon. (And i live in the city and am not finicky about noise) 2. The bluetooth system doesn't reliably connect -- and this may be be related to problem No. 1. This is bluetooth headset I've used with another cheap prepay phone from another carrier without issue. 3. The software has a serious problem in the phone app. The dialer icon often sits over a contact either in Speed dial tab or in the recent calls tab. But I often use to the dialer to punch in numbers and tapping the dialer icon often dials the number under the icon while at the same time raising the dialer keypad. It's a software problem and I suspect this is Verizon at work, but it could be Google and the constantly changing android interfaces. Anyway, I can cope with this by keeping the speed dial as clear as possible, so the the dialer icon is isolated. When I went to the Verizon storefront, I got a snotty clerk, who found it necessary to tell me, \"This is a smartphone and you got to learn to use it.\" So Verizon has picked my pocket one time, but I'd never sign up for a regular plan with the company.",

            "body": "I selected a seller offering a used model in \"Very Good\" condition for $49.95 (JP Mobiles LLC) and, like many reviewers, ended up with a carrier locked phone. But the seller had me the unlock code within a day of me contacting them, and all is well. The handset arrived bubble-wrapped in a generic box with a mini USB charging cable and a Samsung plug adapter. All worked fine and were in excellent condition. The handset looks like a new out-of-the-box piece with no blemishes and functions perfectly. The Lumia 635 looks better in person than in pictures with its Gorilla Glass face and black shell. It has no physical buttons, so the entire face is just the glass and the edge of the rear shell. Sitting on my desk, it looks like a fine piece of tinted glass, uniformly dark. Even the NOKIA logo is barely visible. It attracts fingerprints easily, but they wipe off just as easily. Really nice looking. It's larger than an iPhone 5S but probably a tiny bit smaller than an iPhone 6. I really like the Windows Phone UI. It's easily and broadly customizable and flows well. I really like how I can add tiles not just to programs, but to specific pages. I have four MSN Weather tiles set at the top of my feed for four different cities, so when I open the main screen, I can see the current temperature for each city immediately. There are negatives. Screen resolution and the processor are mid-tier quality at best. There are far better camera phones out there. My car radio won't recognize it and play music when plugged into the USB port. App support is terrible, of course, but Facebook and Twitter are on board. I'm using the handset as a secondary test phone at work, so that's all fine, but this phone could never be my daily driver. If your data usage is limited to Facebook, Twitter, and web browsing, this is a fine handset available at a tremendous value compared to Android and Apple products. And you'll have something that stands out over your friends' handsets.",

            "body": "I'm in LOVE with the camera on this phone! Pictures don't come out fuzzy even when you crop or zoom in, it automatically focuses pretty darn good with \"close-ups\"! I use it a lot with taking many pictures of items for sale on Ebay. But I don't know what's wrong with the \"phone\" and windows? I keep buying this phone just because of the CAMERA and just needing a simple \"phone\" and it works great for about 6 months and issues begin to happen. Right now the message feature will lock up after one word, so my messages to be able to send Iwouldneedtowriteitlikethis all together without spaces to be able to send it. The battery charge is only lasting like 3-5hrs when it use to last all day and the voice is sometimes not able to understand, either intermittent seconds of cut off or sounding muzzled but I don't know if that's the service or the phone. The camera feature is now locking up sometimes... This phone would be \"too good to be true\" if it would just last longer! The camera feature does work amazing for a long time until now over a year. I'd give it a 5+ star for the first 6 months of working great but it's just too good to be true, for it starts to die after that and it's why I gave it a 2 star. I'm already looking at other cellphones again but trying them out always brings me back to considering to buying this one AGAIN for a 3rd time! =( There's NOTHING out there that can compare, maybe if I put insurance on it, I can keep trading in for a new one every 6 months? IDK, this is so frustrating!",

It is fast, responsive, and sleek. Has a nice, \"real\" feel in hand. Again, very surprising purchase. But (and this will frighten you), this phone did not come factory reset. It was synced to a user's email, revealing their banking information, name, LinkedIn job searches, and so on. Very scary. The Internet can be a dangerous place when your personal information is available this easy. Note to Amazon (who fulfilled the order), and the seller: You need to be very careful when selling Window's devices that have not been factory reset -- or any device for that matter. Had we been different people, we could have ruined this poor person's life all because of your negligence.",

            "body": "I bought this phone in July 2016. I was undoubtedly worried that there was a catch to the low price for this phone. It arrived on time, worked as expected and I have suffered no issues since having it. Disclaimer: I have dropped it a few times. It still works dependably and I haven't seen any mechanical errors yet. The windows phone operating system is great. It compliments my windows tablet very well and has a cozy design. The features are easy to find and there's rarely endless and confusing sub-menus like iphones. Minor complaints: It doesn't seem to dim enough at night when I'm using it in the dark or brighten enough on the sunniest southern summer days. The screen came with a very small area that was scratched and the screen seems to scratch somewhat easily, but is still very easy to view. I'll probably buy Nokia phones from now on",

            "body": "Can't get much better than this for a budget phone. Fast and smooth with a quad core. Not many phones out there with quad cores at this price. Memory was 512mb and listed as being expandable but further research indicates you wouldn't want to expand onto an SD card as it would become slower. That was my original intention, but it runs smoothly with 512mb of RAM and doesn't need an upgrade (I'm also not one to play graphic heavy games on my phone as I'll leave that for my desktop). File system is not quite the same as android. For each file windows associates that file with a program and won't show up in file searches. I added music files to the phone and wanted to add them as ringtones, but found I had to do a bit of a workaround to get my own custom ringtones on there. Msft provided steps to do it and it worked out just fine (just not as convenient as android). Battery life is good and goes about 2 days -2.5 days and I play a lot of candy crush. Camera is \"Okay\". No camera on front, but for what I use it for, I don't need one (don't do video chats or take selfies). I upgraded to windows 10 but couldn't stand it and reverted back to windows 8. Cortana didn't work and forced to move towards the outlook app which was inconvenient with 2 emails. Also found Windows 10 browser didn't run as smoothly as the windows 8 version and things just were not intuitively simple (i.e. where my fingers wanted to go was not where they had to go). Having gone back to windows 8.1 I'm loving it again and love the customization of times and layout of email.",

They can explore the phone capabilities easily and make things as big or small as they like. The interface is easy to understand for someone who has never used a touch phone before and so they can get as technical as they like but this doesn't make it boring for a more advanced user. Great battery life and it's a durable phone. I will say this model is starting to not support the newest windows phone software though because it is an older model.

It is half the size and inexpensive enough for him to replace as regularly. He did cut the amount of apps he installs on his phone to optimize speed. He still continues to lose or drop his phone.

Battery life is at least 2-3 days with limited internet/apps usage/e reader usage. Note: this did not include videos or games so cannot offer details regarding battery life usage using these (yet). Using phone on a Straighttalk plan and only some issues with outgoing text attachments not being received by other phone subscribers (t-mobile).

What a shame AT&T castrated their version of this phone. But, What a Value at the price we got. We can make and receive calls again as the local towers were ignoring our old phones, and we can now see to do the texts that my spouses job had begun to require. We bought two of these from different sellers. One to get my spouse a working and text capable phone again, and the second when we saw how well it worked. The first purchase included a photocopied? and unreadable manual, and although sold as new had some minor wear and missing paperwork that made me think is was a pristine return or factory recon. The second phone was perfect.",

Multiple service calls with CC since they are the only ones with whom I can speak have yielded nothing. I can do everything with this phone except MMSC messaging. After many settings changes, resets (my phone and with CC) nothing works. The forums are awash in others with the same problem and with various claims of success which all don't agree with each other. Many statements of \"these are the settings that work\" but disagreement reigns. Some commenters are ready to set fire to Microsoft or somebody others to give their phones back. Nobody seems to implicate AT&T whose network is being used. So great phone but unless you have some magic pixi dust, a service like I have will prevent you from enjoying MMSC and grandkid photos. Have to use email instead.",

I would recommend removing the protector as well as the easily removed plastic sheet that protects the screen during shipping; .... and of course ordering a quality screen protector for the lumia 635.",

One criticism is that the applications are of a very \"proprietary nature\" so that only those allowed by Windows may be installed. I wish there were more freedom of choice other than the app store provided. Also, if one is on a limited budget (prepaid) then you will want to switch-off many of the apps as these require minutes. So far, the Nokia Lumia 635 meets expectations. It did ship, on time and set-up was easy after I requested configurations settings from my network carrier.",

However compared to the much more expensive and feature loaded 920, this 635 has turned out to be the better phone: this immediately recognized my home wifi network. When I put the SIM card in from Consumer Cellular, I was immediately able to make calls. Cortona worked the first time I set it up. The screen is bright, the signal is strong and so far I am pleased ! The 920 is another story: no wifi connection at my house, did not recognize my SIM card (this is a HUGE problem per Google) and even after downloading updates on my neighbor's wifi, still no Cortona despite 8.1 being downloaded. I gave up and am returning it. So I bought another 635 as my backup phone. Hope it works as well as the first one I have !",

With this, the sound is great at mid volume, the speaker is clear and it is easy to use. It has features that I wasn't expecting and would rather pay for this phone than buy the jacked up prices other phones cost. The battery is long. I can go a few days without charging and I don't need to worry about playing a movie on it and then find a place to charge it. I also like the Windows base instead of Android or Apple. I wish the Windows version was closer to the laptop windows version, but close enough that I can use the same files. I bought a case for it and I have people asking me what brand it is.

I have a 635, same phone, I bought it at a Microsoft store and it was truly \"unlocked.\" (3 years ago, appx). Mine and hers are NOTHING alike. Hers is a mess, confusing, has weird apps. The Cortana which she loved to use isn't functioning much at all. The GPS directions feature has failed her and she's been lost trying to get to see her grandkids play sports games around the metro.

Finally I updated to Win 10 and things got better. It's still not perfect but the final version of Win 10 hasn't been released yet. Battery lasts over a day but I'm not a power user. The phone has only 512 MB of RAM but is pretty responsive none the less. No visible lag so far. Other than that Windows 10 is fun to use and I can do almost anything I could do with my Android phone.",

The writing is extremely small and very light I am unable to read from pages 2-22 so it has been a challenge for me to get familiar with the instructions in a timely manner. I got an email from the Good Guys about my comments stating they wanted positive feedback. As previous stated this 635 Lumia is extremely difficult to use without proper instruction from a guide that is impossible to read. I am not happy with this purchase.",

Fortunately, my brother-in-law had this phone and needed to switch carriers, so he gave us his Lumia 635. She has been using it now for four or five months with absolutely no problems. The build is light but not flimsy, the performance is quick, the camera takes acceptable pictures (so long as you have good lighting), and it does absolutely everything that my wife was doing with her iPhone 4S... with one exception: the lack of a camera FLASH. For my wife, this is a pretty big sore spot, because she likes using her phones' flash as a flashlight. She has told me repeatedly that were it not for this issue, she would have zero issues with this device. If lack of a flash (and flashlight) mean little to you, then this is a no-brainer. If you DO want a flash and better specs, the newer Lumia 640 (this phone's replacement) is better-equipped, but costs a bit more.",

            "body": "I got this phone for my son who's going to Europe this summer. He's had a regular phone on our Verizon family plan but, after some investigation, I found out that their international plan is ridiculous. So...I researched the GoPhone, found out he can just exchange the sim card for one he can purchase in each country he visits, and decided to give it a try. I figured if it didn't work out, I was only out $46. The phone arrived in two days, fully packaged (that assured me it wasn't used or refurbished). It comes with a sim card so all you have to do is call and activate it and they give you your new phone number. We decided to try it out for a few days just to be sure he was going to like it before we dropped his phone from Verizon and ported his old number. He absolutely loves it! He keeps saying he can't believe it's a $46 phone! The speed that it loads videos and music is better than my iphone and the call clarity is great! The live tiles are cool, too, and the expandable memory (with a memory card) is going to be great for taking lots of travel pictures. It even has an FM radio which is unique in this day and age. After getting his seal of approval, we decided to drop him from our contract and port his old number. A ten minute phone call and he was good to go. This was, by far, the easiest cell phone experience I've ever had! Side note.....I've had to call AT&T a few times for various things (setting up the phone, porting his old number, and questions about oversees calling.....basic \"newbie\" things) and I cannot begin to tell you how awesome their customer service is! The people are easily understood, very friendly, and my longest wait was when they ported the old number and I had to stay on the line while we waited for the Verizon operator to do what he needed to do (rolling my eyes). A few things to note: This phone cannot be used with Verizon. If you pay for unlimited data, be aware that it slows down considerably after you've used your 1.5GB. You can still use the data (or wifi, of course) but streaming videos on data is just about impossible at the slower speed. Take care to use wifi as much as possible and it won't be an issue. There is no flash to the camera (which I really don't understand) or front facing camera so selfies will have to be done in bright light with a mirror and skype might be difficult (this doesn't bother my son because he's not a \"selfie guy\" and he can skype with his laptop). The one thing he found that he wishes he had is more app selections. They're quite limited in comparison to others but It's not enough of an issue to dislike the phone. If you're on the fence about this one, I say go for it! I am so happy I didn't listen to my husband about how prepay is a pain and more expensive. That's simply not true! When my son leaves for Europe, I just won't buy anything for his phone while he's gone and pick back up when he returns. With Verizon, we'd be paying for a service he couldn't use. Also, we can adjust his plan to meet his needs. If he needs more data, we simply buy more for a month. Then, when he starts paying for his own phone, if he can't afford data, he can drop it to talk and text only and just use Wifi when he needs internet. There are just so many options, it seems silly to be under contract.",

The cons:(not all these will matter if just want a basic smartphone) on screen keyboard is small and you WILL inadvertently miss type things I promise, no flash for camera(also means no flashlight app),speaking of apps...this is a windows phone...so nothing from Google play works on this (you think that would be common sense considering its not Android but still tried just to make sure). You still get fb and Twitter. No chrome or Firefox you are stuck with internet explorer. Cortana works decently and for some reason understands voice input (corrects better) than if you are voice texting. I have owned this phone for 1 month and recently it has begun to lockup in the middle of youtube(screen goes black)but you can still hear the audio, and can only be remedied by holding the per button until it shuts off and then reset the battery. Again, as a basic cheap possibly entry level smartphone this thing is pretty nice, do not expect its features to outshine a higher end phone",

For example Snapchat and YouTube ect. When buying this phone this should weigh in your decision whether to get the Nokia lumia 635. If your looking for a cheap smartphone an match up to an iPhone or galaxy s4 or one of those phones I recomend boy product smartphones. Other that I loved the Nokia lumia 635 I found cortana extremely useful and helpful thru out the small time period I had this phone. I hoped this helped anyone that is looking to purchase this phone or any low priced smartphone in general.",

To me, Samsung's last winner was the S6 & S6 Edge. Nothing after this has interested me. Samsung has lost their ability to produce a well engineered, high quality, and therefore reliable, cell phone. I've had my 1st S6 Edge since October 2015 and not quite two years later in August 2017 I just bought this 2nd one for my wife a few weeks ago. Glad I did. I sure wish manufacturers would put quality FIRST versus trying to out do the other guy with more bells and whistles or stupid ideas that THEY think WE want / need.",

            "title_review": "A good choice for the price (on Amazon)!",
            "body": "This phone is beautiful! It really is cool looking and sleek. The black sapphire looks sparkly blue in the light. REALLY pretty! However, it is VERY slippery in the hand. I was so nervous I'd drop it in the 24 hours before my case arrived ( Galaxy S6 Edge case, E LV Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (SHOCK PROOF DEFENDER) Slim Case Cover - Impact Protection **NEW**[Black] Ultimate protection from drops and impacts for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge [BLACK / BLACK ])! I've had the phone for 2 weeks now and all of the functions it advertises work. I'm still figuring some of them out and had the price not been so good on Amazon, I wouldn't have sprung for the edge. The notifications and people functions are cool, but totally unnecessary. The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up to work with multiple fingers (up to 4) and works very well. The backup password is more secure than a typical 4 digit code (had to be at least 8(?) characters),though I haven't had any problems opening the phone with my fingerprint. The heart rate monitor is really cool. I've been checking it at various times of the day and it's cool to see how low (or high!) your heart rate is. Overall, the response to using apps and web pages is fast. It loads webpages really quickly, email was easy to set up and my gmail and hotmail accounts are easy to access from the same icon and I can switch between them with a simple swipe. My work email loads quickly and works as expected as well. The way the email system is set up, it allows you to swipe right or left to get to the next or previous message which I've found rather convenient. So far, the battery is great! I've been warned against \"over charging\" so I never leave it charging overnight, as I did my previous phone. The fast charging is really super-fast. I'd say it gets a full charge in less than 2 hours. I've charged in the evening prior to going to bed, stopped it at 95% and it was still around 20% the following night with moderate to heavy use (no gaming/video streaming, just talk, text, email, web-surfing). The camera does take very clear shots of stable scenes. Haven't played with the settings or different modes at all yet. Straight auto shooting of moving kids haven't always been clear, but that's more likely due to user error than the fault of the camera. Unless this is also user-error (I haven't looked into it yet) I cannot seem to take a picture directly from a text message. With my old phone I could go into a group message, take a picture and have it automatically attach to the message. If this phone allows that, it isn't an obvious feature. Ditto for simply attaching an existing picture to a message. I have to go into the gallery, pick the picture, add the recipients, and then write a message to send it. Again, this might be a function I haven't figured out yet, but it shouldn't be rocket science to do this. There's usually a little paper clip somewhere in the messaging app that allows attachments. Not so on this phone. I bought a tempered glass protector, but it made it very difficult for the phone to recognize my touch. I ended up removing it as I was too frustrated by it. That may a problem of the protector I chose ( S6 Edge Screen Protector, AOKDO [Full Screen Coverage] Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (clear) ) rather than the phone, but my screen is currently naked and I am worried about it breaking as it seems pretty fragile. I will say it is a bit glitchy at times even without the screen protector. I have had issues with it not responding to my touch when I try to scroll up/down or open an application. Not often enough to make me want to return it, but annoying none the less (especially since I chose this phone over another due to the frequency of complaints on reviews of the other phone for this exact issue). I'm hoping it doesn't get worse over time. There is a system update pending, but I haven't allowed it without doing a little research. Maybe that will fix the issue. I believe this is more of a Verizon complaint than specific to the phone, but you cannot do anything else on the phone while speaking to someone. You can't use mobile data to send a text message, use an app, use google maps to get directions, or look something up on the web if you're using the phone/calling function. I read that this is true of all new Verizon phones, but annoying none the less. Overall, I do like the phone a lot. I'd say there are a lot of features that make this a great phone. The minor irritations are just that: minor. All in all a good choice for the price!",

I recommend getting a case for this though as it seems like it could break but so far, it hasn't had any dents or scratches with a case on.",

The edge designs feels great in your hand, however, the integration in to the software and functionality is very limited. The edge screen helps create shortcuts to your favorite apps, top contacts and even allows you to set up shortcuts to execute certain tasks. The battery is not as strong as that of the Samsung Galaxy S6 (non-Edge) but I guess that is the trade off for visual design and feel. The functionality of the light up edge screen based off preset contacts is useful however not a true necessity.",

            "body": "*The S6 Edge is one of the most unique phones on the market. Instead of the Note Edge having one edged screen, the S6 version has 2. That means that the normal screen is all screen, there will be no notification drops; all of them are displayed at the side.* *Just a quick disclaimer: I just got this phone today at BestBuy and Ive been playing with it for a lot of time nonstop. So far the experience is great and nearly perfect. I encountered no stutters, no lag, no glitches, nothing. I downloaded a couple graphically intensive games and it ran all of them very well. And all in all navigating through the Touchwiz UI was surprisingly smooth, something that I wish I could've complimented in the past Samsung phones. Right now the battery is at 31 percent for me.* Oh god this phone is a masterpiece. Let me just start out by saying that I've had the S5 for about 6 months now. I've mostly liked the phone. I liked it's dependable battery life, it's water and dust resistance, it's gorgeous display, etc. But I felt like some things about it were just a deal breaker. The Touchwiz UI was no better than looking in a trash can. It was slow to respond and had these peculiar bleeps and bloop sounds that were rather annoying than adding something convenient. The air gestures were dope to use first but it quickly got useless. The settings were a total mess and it left a sour taste to a myriad of users including me. I'm most defenitely not the person who will hate any phone because it is made out of plastic and love the other because it has metal, but I did like a well built phone. It's not like I would hate a plastic phone but the S5 did have a better design than the S4, but it still wasn't good. It was an improvement but not one that I loved holding instantly when I picked it up unlike HTC phones. All in all, the S5 wasn't for everyone. Then I saw this phone at MWC 2015. I didn't go the the event but I did watch some videos of this phone at the event. I saw that the S6 had better design, it was made out of glass, it had no expandable storage or battery replacement option, the Touchwiz UI was less \"Touchweezy\" and much cleaner and faster, it had much better specs inside, and there was an S6 edge version. I knew that the S6 was a phone that I've wanted from Samsung long time but I had to experience it firsthand to believe it. So I brought this phone Day 1 from Best Buy, and I have to say, this phone is almost everything that I've wished for. Pros: -Very premium to hold. There is actual metal around the edges, not just shiny plastic and the back is made out of glass, just like the Nexus 4. -The display is the best out of any phone in the market at the moment (4/10/15). Samsung upgraded the display from 1080p to 1440p. This makes it sharper and clearer, but you won't notice the difference that much side by side unless you look close. Also, in traditional Samsung fashion, the phone has great colors, excellent contrast ratio, etc. -Touchwiz UI is cleaner and better than ever. The whole UI seems fast and fluid, especially since it's running on Android 5.0 Lollipop. Some of the features like Air Gesture are no longer there in the settings. It looks flatter. -Great performance. Samsung ditched Qualcomm for their processors in their phone now and they decided to put their well known Exynos processor inside this phone. They also put 3 GB of DDR4 Ram now. The result is a beastly phone that does almost anything you throw at it. Graphically intensive games run very well even at high settings and everyday tasking is smooth. Runs like a beast. -Very fast to charge. I had the battery at 21% and charged it for 30 minutes and it instantly went up to 93%. -Camera has less noise on low light pictures and there is OIS now. Cons: -Not IP67, meaning its not dust proof or water resistant. It would've been nice if they still kept that extra protection from the S5 to this phone, but I haven't dropped a phone in the water for nearly a decade, so this isn't a huge problem for me. -Battery is not replacable. Its quite a sad thing for Samsung to cut down, since most of their old phones had this feature. If your battery is dead, then too bad, you have to either go to an Electronics support store and get it fixed or buy a new phone. Luckily, a phone's battery life R.I.P's after 2 or 3 years, so its a long lifespan. -No SD Card Storage. This is what bugs me and this is why Im quite confused why Sammy left this feature out. The HTC One M9 has an SD Card storage. Is it made out of plastic? No. The glass back on the S6 is perfectly capable of adding a storage slot to expand memory. Thankfully the base line of the S6 has 32GB, which is adequate for most people.",

            "body": "I had a S6. Went to put a memory card in it, but Samsung skipped that version, so instead, I had to download all of my pictures,etc., because it ran so slow (was pretty full). Battery life was so so, I just charged it anytime I was near my charger to ensure it didn't quit. This was imperative as I ran an application that tracked blood sugars for diabetes and was always running down. Open a game, and it went to zero. The annoyance of having to go into my phone app and click on voice calls only so I could clear out the calls EACH time was beyond my understanding. Why it didn't allow the filter to stay on my choice, but default to all text messages and calls says poor attention to engineering to me, esp. from your users perspective. Finally, after a couple of years (I'm not one to change cars or phones every six months), I accidentally dropped the phone into water. I immediately removed it, but when I looked on the net to see how I could open the back to dry out the components (it was still trying to work) and saw I had to have a heat gun, a guitar pick, a couple of playing cards and a suction cup tool, I gave up. Needless to say, it died. Meanwhile, my sister has stayed with another Korean competitor, has dropped her phone many times on the ground and in water, and has been able to still use it. For the cost of these new phones, I'll never buy this manufacturer again (ask me about their dryers!). Decent graphics and the camera was ok.",

            "body": "Speaking from someone who enjoys using new technology and an Android lover, I'm not certain if this is an advancement from the S5, but then again I didn't own the S5 (just was not drawn to it or impressed by the possibility of it - I opted for the LG G3), while the last flagship iteration of the Galaxy S series I last owned was the S3 in 2012 (flagship maker for Samsung's Galaxy S series). The S3 was a great phone, but it was plagued by battery life like most other Android phones at that time. To the present 2015-2016, after a month of usage, my impression is clearer. Between the S3 and S6, it's a mixed bag of advancement and drawbacks. First obvious is the lack of removable back and expandable memory. Why Samsung would go away from one of the significant reason I appreciated the Android flagship and sway towards the \"wanna be\" likeness with Apple, I don't know. From me to Samsung, listen to your users and stay true. I bought this phone honestly out of curiosity to answer that very question. Why the unibody? My answer? After a month of use, I do find this phone quite enjoyable to use, call quality, voice and music sound quality is exceptional with APT-X built in -- it's noticeable, compared to the Note 3 & 4, the S6 Edge is a great improvement in overall sound experience - via bluetooth and aux cable. The super AMOLED display does not disappoint. This phone and future phones in my opinion threaten to cannibalize it's own manufacturer's tablet sales market. As I currently own the Samsung 9.7 LTE Tab S2 and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition Tablet, I find myself using this phone to browse, shop, surf, check email, etc, more so than my tablets. I find the one handed usage with the high resolution of this AMOLED display to be ample and pleasant. What type of user am I? I use this phone for it's Bluetooth music listening, voice calls, email checking, apps craigslist/ebay/amazon shopping, mobile banking, YouTube streaming (although I have Netflix, Crackle and Prime, my Verizon data plan limit my freedom of data usage, that's another beef I won't go into detail), and email checking. I connect to the LG Tone Ultra headsets for voice and music (another great product). I also actively own and use the Note 5 concurrently with this phone. And I have to admit the Note 5 experience is much more smooth and fluid than the S6 Edge, but because the size of this phone in my hand feels more relaxed and natural, I lean towards the S6 Edge (longing for the Note 5 fluid and smoothness). Why S6 Edge versus the regular S6, or waiting just a few more weeks for the S7 release? Because I knew that the S7 will not have the 5.1 inch version of the Edge. The S7 offering is only the 5.1 inch non-edge and S7 Edge 5.5 bigger version similar to S6 Edge plus. I like the 5.1 inch size with the Edge capabilities. I enjoy the Edge on the 5.1 inch screen which naturally fits in my hand while offering the unique market differentiating look and feel of the Edge design and features. What I find lacking in the S6 Edge is the battery life and compared to the Note 5, the smoothness and fluid performance. with that said, Samsung has convinced me I don't need the removable back cover or expandable memory with 32GB of storage. Now for the battery life, it needs help, Starting my day at 5am, by 8am I'm already at 50% with general usage and mostly on idle time. The S6 Edge is a wall hugger, which is shameful at this stage of the game. Surprisingly the S6 has the same battery life behavior as the S3. That's not a compliment. What makes it tolerable is quick charging which is somewhat the saving grace and the Edge innovation. I do have the Incipio black case and Military Shield screen protector installed, which dramatically enhances my experience and hand confidence greatly. I highly recommend this combination of pairing. Bottom-line: I could give it 5 stars because you will enjoy the premium engineering and build of this phone. It's rich - naturally non-fatigue hand held usage (properly paired with the right screen protector and case), APT-X digital quality sound, voice calls with no complaints, high resolution 2k Super Amoled screen (brilliantly eye pleasing), unique and innovative Edge design and features, all positive advancements. I give props to Samsung for convincing me I don't need the removable back and expandable memory, but the shameful and appalling poor battery life is just disappointing, downright unforgivable, while the software speed and smoothness just isn't quite as refined as the Note 5 or even more surprisingly my old LG G3. I imagine the S7 will be a great phone -- which to me is like the dream team of features, disappointingly, I may not hop on it, since the S7 lacks the Edge offer on a 5.1 inch version. What the S7 release allows the market to do is still value this phone as relevant since it's the only 5.1 inch Edge offer from Samsung until possibly the S8.",

Essentially, this device has the same specifications as its brother-device, the Galaxy S6, so performance wise you can\u2019t go wrong with either. What distinguishes the S6 Edge from its counterpart, of course, is the new Dual-Edge design, which has such features as a Night Clock, Edge Lighting (for special contacts when they call) and the People\u2019s Edge, which keeps your top 5 contacts readily available (like speed dial) on the edge-screen. Also, when compared to the new IPhone 6s, the Galaxy S6/S6 Edge, for example, boasts of 3GB of RAM to Apple\u2019s 1GB RAM, the front cam contains a 5MP lens and 16 in the rear, which double the camera specs of the new IPhone; and the display, Edge features 3.6M pixels to Apple\u2019s 1M pixel display. So if we are talking hardware to performance ratio, the Galaxy S6 Edge has a major advantage over Apple\u2019s latest flagship. In comparison with its counterpart, the Galaxy S6, the Edge wins in a beauty contest and is deadlocked for specs and performance. This phone is blazing fast and ultra-slim and is highly recommended.",

            "body": "If you know what you're getting into buying this phone, then you probably won't be dissapointed. Let me start out by saying, I have owned the M9, Note 3, iPhone 6, etc. The Note 3 being the most recent phone I've been using. So my comparisons start with the competitively similar models. I've got the plus model, but it's close enough. I'll try to make this short and sweet. The Good: -Great screen (although VERY oversaturated) -Decent volume -Excellent charge time (sub 30 min. for a full charge) -Solid build quality (more on the edge issues though) The Okay: -Camera is decent, image quality fair, highly compressed but typical of smart phones -Processing speed, it's typical, the average user won't need the umph these phones have anyway The Bad: -The curved screen can be very frustrating to deal with, easy to touch button you didn't mean to, etc. -EXTREMELY limited case market. I know some don't use cases, but for the other 90%, case selection is abysmal. -Touch screen sensitivity, is simply OKAY. That's with no screen protector, etc. Often missing taps and touches when gaming -BATTERY LIFE This part gets its own area. The battery, is just not good. Coming from a Note 3, you will miss having a reasonable charge throughout a full day of moderate to heavy use. This thing CHUGS through battery life. Yes it charges quickly, but I find myself to 75% by lunch having only checked my emails and maybe briefly listening to music. I have app killer on as well. I tried without app killer, and it was worse. This alone made me almost return the phone. Conclusion: If you want a good phone, with decent specs, decent screen, and can work around the issues mentioned above go for it. Be warned though, I'm not kidding about the case selection. I ended up with a LOVE MEI case, as most others either didn't do enough, or got in the way of the curved screen (which is the ONLY reason to buy this over the Note 5.",

            "body": "However most of the time it is absolute garbage. This phone drops WiFi signal CONSTANTLY. And yes I have turned off the auto switch! Even when the WiFi is connected it only loads things when it feels like it (this isn't just tested on my network!) The default keyboard is crap, the software makes other apps crash frequently and there are some extremely frustrating steps backwards from the S4. One example is that you can't cancel downloades! You have to go all the way into your settings>app manager>all>your browser>force stop!!! This is so dumb!!! Also, on the s4 you could hold down on a notification and get to the app settings page right from there. Useful feature right? Well Samsung junked it and now it takes you to a page where you can make the notifications high priority or make them not show up (even though they will still run, such as a download). When this phone works its great, but good luck finding those rare gems.",

            "body": "There is no denying that this is a great looking phone, but I'm only giving 2 stars because my auto-rotate function is stuck after only 3 days of use. My camera is permanently inverted (i need to hold it upside down if I want to take a picture), and the orientation does not change when turning the phone sideways (for everything: camera, games, chrome, etc.). I found many other people online who are having the exact same problem and some have even swapped phones several times. I went in to the Verizon store, and they contacted their Samsung rep. The first one said he was unaware of this issue. I showed the Verizon salesperson all the websites detailing other people having the exact same issue, and they \"said\" they contacted a 2nd Samsung rep, who said it was a Software issue and they were working on a patch. The next day I decided to call Samsung support because I didn't fully trust the Verizon folks. The operator said that Samsung was not aware of this issue and he'd escalate the problem the best that he could. I just want to know if this is a hardware or software issue, and nobody can give me an official answer. I only have 5 more days to wait for a software patch before I reach the Verizon return deadline. I'm probably going to end up returning it and move on to a different device, which is a shame because it is such a fantastic-looking phone. My advice to potential buyers, is wait a couple months until they figure this out... or just go with the non-edge version (the issue appears to only be affecting the S6 edge) Update ** 5/7/2015 ** The best answer I received from Verizon was that it is most likely a software glitch and Samsung is working on a patch (no timeframe given). They offered to replace the phone, but it would take 2 weeks because of an s6 edge shortage. Samsung Support said they were looking in to my complaint. I could send them my phone and they'd either fix it or send me a replacement in 10 days. I didn't like either option and decided to exchange it on the last day of my verizon \"return window\" for the regular S6. I've been using the non-edge version for a week and a half now and I love the phone. I won't go in to long comparison because I didn't get much time with a fully functional S6 Edge, but I will say that the regular s6 feels a lot more stable in my hand. Maybe it's just because I just needed more time to get used to the edge, but it felt \"slicker\". You can read about all the regular features in the other reviews, but there were two things that I really like about the phone (both versions) which I did not know before purchasing it. (this is my first samsung, so sorry if these are old features) 1) The home screen's got a cool \"floating icon\" effect when you tilt the phone --> not useful for anything, but very aesthetically pleasing. 2) The phone allows you to choose up to 30 photos for your lockscreen which will cycle throughout the day. This may not be a gamechanger, but I absolutely love seeing different photos of my 5 month old throughout the day",

            "title_review": "To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because ...",
            "body": "X-posted from Verizon. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the \"gimmick\" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. \"All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along...\" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote \"...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me.\" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using \"carousels\" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the \"edge\" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to \"improve\" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization. Like every other device, this one is rife with pre-installed apps. I didn't do a whole lot of poking around to see if they could all be disabled, but every useless bit of bloatware I wanted gone -- NFL Mobile, all verizon apps except MyVerizon, Milk, Slacker, Facebook, etc. -- was easily disabled. NFC is better implemented than in the S5 resulting in less shifting about to find a \"sweet spot\" so I can more easily use Google Wallet. No problems with BT as there were in the S5, specifically a problem I had with using BT devices such as my fitbit that caused WiFi to go on the fritz while BT was active. IR transmitter is superb & the included Peel Smart Remote app took less than a minutes to configure for both my television & DirecTV box & I haven't needed to reach for a remote since. I'm not a camera junkie & I seldom take pictures of anything other than my dog being an idiot, but I have to admit that the pictures look pretty amazing. Given my limited experience, the editing tools where pretty intuitive but tbh, I only cropped a few Pics. Aside from the screen & performance & wireless charging another real improvement is in the audio when compared to my previous devices. Mind you, just as I'm not a camera junkie, I'm also not an audiophile. Like my previous handsets this has a single speaker, but unlike those it is set in the bottom edge of the phone rather than the back. I used to have to turn the volume to max & cup my hand around the back of my S5 to get decent audio but whether the S6's speaker is so significantly improved or its placement is better or a combination of the two, this thing is LOUD! I usually turn on an audio book to fall asleep to & actually had to turn this down to 50% because it was disturbing my sleep. I do occasionally cover the speaker when holding the device in landscape mode, but that's just because I haven't become fully acclimated to the device. Finally, the form-factor -- that I adore -- will require quite the adjustment from what we've all learned to be standard. It's really an excellent lesson in how uninnovative handset manufacturers have been in re-imagining both the means of delivering content & our interaction with that content -- the screen. When I reach into my pocket I want to grab the rounded bit so I can look at the flat side, because that's the screen, right? The Edge changes that paradigm, perhaps not drastically, but it changes it nonetheless. In my pre-purchase review reading some evaluators considered this an \"ergonomic problem\", some felt that their fingers hit the edge; I've found neither to be a problem. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad & with consistent use I've found my fingers fit quite comfortably on the aluminum surround without messing with the screen. Form-wise, it is instantly recognizable as a S-Series phone, but this iteration is a superb high-end rendering of that aesthetic. Although I run the risk of overstating how visually appealing this device is, I am willing to label it an objet d'art. One that I was almost afraid to use due to its apparent fragility until a few accidental drops on tile confirmed that it is as durable as it is beautiful as it is functional. Thoroughly, thoroughly pleased.",

However, this IPhone is refurbished and doesn\u2019t come from the original box or the accessories from Apple. Instead was delivered in a cheap white rectangular box that says Amazon renewed and contains a $12-15 dollar sharkk charger. Only give it 5 stars because of the condition of the phone unimpressed with the accessories that it comes with!! Had no issues with activating my SIM card to phone it was completely unlocked\u2026",

            "body": "So after my then phone iPhone 6 S/Plus began acting up doing all sort of strange thing on its own I began my hunt for a new iPhone and settled on this... Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed Premium). I was a little sceptical at first about buying a used phone but the new ones were a bit too expensive for me. So I decided to take the chance especially seeing the \"Premium\" added to the description. Turned out to be a good choice. I received the phone and did a restore from my backup which went seamlessly and painlessly...and also extremely fast. In no time at all I was back up and running with everything intact. To begin with there were no scratches on the phone...condition perfect. And when I checked battery health I got a reading of 100%. So as said it was like buying a brand new phone. No regrets whatsoever.",

The phone came in excellent condition, maybe one tiny mark on back but I studied it pretty hard after reading past reviews. I most likely would not have noticed. Very easy to set up since I had an iPhone before. Just transfered all info over. The charge lasts me all day! At the end of the day I still have a charge left. Haven't really taken any piTunes yet so can't say how good they will be. I love this phone!",

            "body": "Initially, I was impressed. This phone came out of the box looking new, I could not detect a scratch. It was very well packaged and worked well for about 2 weeks. Then my son started telling me about the phone freezing and shutting down and apps not working, et. I was so disappointed since I suggested purchasing the phone on Amazon. Now he is traveling out of the US and stuck with a horrible phone. I contacted Amazon to see if they could assist with a return - however, this is complicated by the fact that my son is traveling. After 40 minutes on the phone trying to find a solution, it boiled down to shipping. So I suggested sending it Amazon.UK. That was a no go from Amazon. I can understand that I guess. However, my son is still stuck with a nonfunctional phone that costs $500 and he will have to send it to me and then I will have to send it Amazon. What a mess! I have never seen an I-phone go down so quickly. I ordered premium service so at least I can return it eventually (although I'm still getting the shaft on S&H). Too bad, the phone truly was impressively packed and as advertised looked new with brand new accessories. Maybe I just got a lemon. In any case the phone did not function or work like new. If you are considering buying this phone, give this a try if you are going to able to give a good test run and be in the US to get support. I gave one as a gift to a recent Grad going abroad and it did not work out well.",

Initial inspection yielded a slight nick on the side of the case but nothing major and covered by any aftermarket case protector. I think the phone I received was better than average though and don\u2019t think it reflects what is normal. No scratches to screen or camera lenses. All function perfect. Can\u2019t detect any issues with speaker or microphones. Accurately measures my elevation changes (hiker). Bluetooth, WiFi, wireless and corded charging/data work fine. GPS and compass work well. I received it and was surprised to see 100% battery health. Have had it over a month and hasn\u2019t changed which is impressive. Suspecting that may have been changed so question how good the waterproof sealing may be, although it would have been an apple performed repair so maybe no reason to worry? I\u2019m a little concerned reading about issues people have with the returns but overall it\u2019s been a good product for me with no issues.",

It is in good condition for a used phone with no scratches on the screen, it does have a few small chips in the paint, but again, for a used phone it is in really good condition. I was easily able to get it activated, and have noticed no problems with the phone after a few days of regular use. I would definitely buy from this seller again!",

I called Google Fi support and they told me this is a Verizon phone (unlocked) but that the eSIM functionality of the device is factory disabled and cannot be re-enabled. I believe Google is working toward allowing dual-SIM, relying on a physical and eSIM in combination. I'd like to be able to use that if it comes out, which is not possible on this phone. And I'd like to take advantage of the eSIM benefits while traveling internationally. I'm giving 2 stars because it does actually WORK, but did not come as described.",

It seems like every time I try to turn my phone on via fingerprint, it takes at least three tries before it actually unlocks. Sometimes it doesn't work at all and I get the \"Too many unsuccessful attempts, please try again later.\" Then I have to retype my password for all the apps that allow fingerprint login which is super annoying.

The phone is unlocked and the Verizon version. Verizon stupidly disabled the eSim, so that is the only feature missing compared to the Google version for most people. The bootloader is also locked on Verizon phones, but unless you are a developer it would be fairly senseless to flash your own rom on these if you even knew how. Back to the disabled eSim - its not really a big deal except for one thing - I keep a Google Fi eSim in my phone for travel, so in essence the Google Pixel 3 lines is dual sim sort of, so when Verizon disabled the eSim they killed the dual sim feature. This phone was for my wife who doesn't need the eSim. So the bottom line is - if you don't need the eSim, and you won't unless you want two sims at once, its a beautiful phone at the lowest price online I have seen. Very happy!",

This phone is amazing! I have read through a couple of other reviews on these phones on how some, unfortunately, didn't get the chance to have a good experience. Due to problems with the phone itself. I don't have a problem with the phone itself and so far I didn't have any problems with the phone, but if you ever do buy a pixel and you start having problems. Be sure to return the product and ask for another one. Everything about the phone from the camera, hardware, up to the user experience its great! I am actually very happy to have this phone.

It took 3 hours to re-activate it. During my time writing this review waiting for my old phone to work again, the battery on this device drained unexpectedly quickly; it was half charge within the hour. I've bought with Amazon refurbished before with better results, but this is the worst purchace I've done. I understand that refurbished products aren't perfect and it is a really good looking phone, but having it suspend my phone number is not up my standards.",

            "body": "Truly the BEST phone I have ever used! This is coming from a person who was burned...(TWICE)... by Google and the Pixel 1's faulty microphone. However I'm a forgiving kind of guy and man am I glad I got over my first experience with Pixel devices and ordered this one! Ok, so what's so good about this phone, huh? EVERYTHING! The phone is super fast and snappy with any APP I use. I'm a heavy gamer and this phone has been able to easily play any games IV thrown at it. Plus they look amazing with the screen in this phone. The OLED screen is such a treat for my eyes. Deep, rich, and vibrant...I love watching movies with it! And I know you've all heard about the \"hideously huge notch\" and how it just ruins everything..... Well, I barely notice it. In fact there are some neat apps that can do some really cool things with the notch like putting a color changing strip around it that will work as notification alert or battery bar. And that leads perfectly to the next great thing, the battery. I am a very heavy user and the battery will last me almost the entire day. The speed charger is blazingly fast so if I should have to plug it in before the days up, it only takes about 10-15 mins to get 25-30%. Then there's the fact that Pixel users get all the updates first. I love rubbing that in Samsung users faces! Let's see....what am I forgetting..... Ahhh yes, saved the best for last. The camera. There aren't words to describe how damn good the camera really is. I still can't believe a cellphone can take pictures like this. Blows my mind. It has actually inspired me to take up photography as a hobby. Not to mention Google will backup and store an UNLIMITED amount of photos and videos for FREE! Yeah, yeah, I know I sound like Googles little fanboy. Hell I admit I am. No shame here! Just go ahead and get this phone and I promise you'll be a fanboy/fangirl too! Theres alot of other great features to this phone that I haven't mentioned so I guess you'll just have to get one and see for yourselves. Trust me you won't regret it! Oh yea, I did buy mine refurbished and it looked like new. Not a scratch on it. the only difference was it came without the original charger. But it refurbed and save yourself few bucks. Now go get PIXELING!",

It arrived and the phone itself looked fine but the screen protector looked like you pulled it off let your tolder eat Cheerios and play on it and then put it back on. Shortly after starting to use it it had overheating problems and shut off. Tried everything I could find on Google to fix it before returning. Second phone from Tech Wholsale. I did pay am extra 15-20 over the cheapest seller. But I figured there was a reason for the higher rating. The phone arrived with a brand new screen protector pre installed. Looks flawless! This phone has absolutely great and if I told anyone I bought it new the minute after I removed it from the package they would believed me. The only negative is that the phone had no charge which is forgivable for a great working phone at the price. . From now on I will only buy used or referb from high rating sellers. Thanks Tech Wholsale!",

Wonder why the seller bothers to sell them at all without testing it using a real Verizon SIM card? Have to return again. Such a waste of time! The phone looks good, but actually when I put in Verizon SIM card, it has trouble to activate it---even after it is activated, the phone volume is soooooo small that is literally non-usable! Surprised the stores are selling phones without basic tests as such---a pure waste of money and time! The problem is I tried to buy an Amazon renewed Pixed 2XL earlier and it had the SAME problem!!! Very disappointed by Amazon renew!",

My product, unlike other reviews, came with all Google licensed accessories, excluding the pixel buds, and an adapter. Product appears new, no scratches, no previous use or wear associated with it. Great phone as well. No complaints so far. I've turned off most of the extras as it drains the battery a lot. Great adaptive battery life, some days with 2 full days of use, and some just a day if I'm using it for a lot. I did buy headphone adapters as I still have some auxiliary cable products. Save your money, its worth it.",

            "body": "I bought this phone one year ago, coming from a Pixel 1. Not to make the review long because there are plenty reviews on YouTube: PROS 1. That camera. Easy to use, great detail, amazing dynamic range, very nice portrait effect and fast. I encountered no issues with it like some other people said. Maybe Google updated the cam app. Moreover, the wide angle selfie camera is a plus. 2. Smartness. This phone is packed with AI features. For example: it records all songs it heard, even if I didn't ask for it. 3. Squeeze for Google Assistant. If you like GA, this is a very quick and handy feature. 4. Front facing speakers. Compared with Pixel 1, the front facing speakers are a beauty. Strong and sound very well. 5. Beautiful screen. This is sharp and colorful. CONS: 1. Relatively slow processor. Don't get me wrong, I like how fast it is, and for my daily basis this is OK. But some heavy apps may result a bit slow for some people, especially comparing the phone to other newer ones like OnePlus 7 Pro. 2. Low RAM. 4 gb is not enough sometimes. For example, opening several apps at the same time and then switching between them is slow. 6 gb would have been much much better. 3. Back easily scratched. But can be solved easily with any case. 4. Screen not very bright. Noticeable while being outside. 5. Notch. I'm already used to it, but it can bother some picky people. Overall, I can say I bought the phone for the camera. I don't really care about anything else. If the processor can handle texting, web browsing, playing music smoothly I'm happy. And it does.",

The battery doesn't last as long as my LG Stylo 4. It does say that the battery may be reduced to 85%. of full capacity so I'll chalk it up to that. Google Assistant is convenient but not overwhelming. The camera is as advertised. Night Sight mode is ridiculously beautiful. Took a photo in a dark cave and it came out so amazing. All in all it feels good to have premium flagship phone without having to pay full price. Well worth the purchase",

            "body": "My wife cracked her screen and put in a Verizon insurance claim to get it repaired. However, uBreakiFix said they couldn't repair it because there was an internal PART MISSING. This was clearly a MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I reached out to Verizon and escalated the issue, but they declined to help and sent me to Google tech support. Google also declined saying that I'd need to get the screen fixed before they could help, which left me in a catch-22. So, bottom line, I was sold A DEFECTIVE PHONE and was forced to pay a replacement phone deductible ($199) to get it replaced. I suspect the uBreakiFix contract may have been specifically setup to ensnare customers into paying the full deductible when the screen breaks, while Google manufacturing cut corners on their phones, all so they can't be fixed. I wonder how many more Pixel 3XL phones have this defect and people are stuck paying the high deductible. THIS IS A CHEAT! Shame on Google and Verizon! I will never again buy another Google phone and am seriously considering dumping Verizon after 20+ years of loyalty. So much for the manufacturer's warranty. It's a joke.",

But I haven't fully activated it because it did not come with the USB-USB C adapter for you to transfer everything over from your old phone. In fact this package did not come with any of the certified Google peripherals. The SAMSUNG charger it came with doesn't even work for the Pixel 3XL. No adapter for carrying over my information, no headphones so I can't listen to sound since this phone requires the new USB C headphones, and finally I can't even use the phone because there is no way to charge it once it's battery runs out. Overall I like that they actually sent me, from what I can see far, decently refurbished product. BUT the fact that I can't use it for anything because all the little external things that a phone requires for use were not included.",

Pros: Excellent battery life, strong and durable, blazing fast, gorgeous large screen/, amazing camera, utilization of the USB-C reversible charge cable. I love this phone and have been nothing short of impressed with it through two months of use. The battery can last 14 hours with moderate to heavy use. I am a photography nut and the camera blows me away consistently. I'm also something of a stickler on the display and the screen is incredible. Cons: No headphone port, which is only a con if you use headphones. No back/menu buttons. I've been using the S7 for close to three years and have always had the back button on my androids. This one eliminates that feature and through two months of use, I still haven't got used to it not being there. The phone isn't truly unlocked. I haven't figured out how to use tethering with this phone on my StraightTalk plan even though I could do it on my old S7. I keep getting \"you aren't subscribed to this service\" and no apps seem to have the workaround. Conclusion: Great phone, especially for this price point. Refurbished condition is only evident in the fact they ship it in a plain cardboard box instead of a fancy Google box.",

            "body": "This review is more about my experience of buying a renewed phone, rather than the phone itself. I purchased this phone to replace my pixel, and the *only* reason I was replacing that was because of the rapid battery drain. I didn't want to spend the money on a new pixel 4 because I'm not impressed with the battery reviews on it. My choices were to replace my pixel battery ($100) or buy a renewed phone for a couple of hundred more than I would have spent to replace the pixel battery. I started watching these renewed pixel 3xls to see how the pricing was going. I didn't want to spend more than $400, so I kept waiting and waiting. Then a 128gb one came up for $367, which I thought was a really good price. I ordered it on a Tuesday, it said it would be here the following Monday, but it arrived during the day on Friday. Yeah! The packaging was really good, the phone was secure. The phone was in a bag in the box, and in the box was also a charger and cable. The phone was not charged, but no biggie. It charged really fast. The one thing I noticed after inspection, was two scratches in the top third of the phone. I was so bummed! Now I knew why the phone was so much less. However, you can only see the scratches at a certain angle and when the screen is off. I can't feel them when running my finger over. So, another decision: can I live with the scratch that is only visible under certain angles, and angles that I would be unlikely to ever hold my phone at and when the screen is off, or do I send it back? I decided to charge it up, install my stuff and see how it goes. Well, the scratches aren't a big deal at all. There is no interference with my phone interaction/useability. It's a trade off, but I think a worthwhile trade off - this is the only physical flaw on the phone. I plan to keep this one until around pixel 6 or so, so again, I think it's worth it. I'm very happy I got a really good deal, and other than the scratches, I feel like the phone is brand new.",

            "body": "I recently purchased this renewed Pixel 3 XL to replace my (very) aging Samsung Note 3. I'm not going to rave about the performance increase for obvious reasons. I will say that I find the usability (UI) of the Pixel 3 vs the Note 3 to be so delightful. It's simple, fluid, and intuitive. It's really nice to no longer have TouchWiz encapsulating the basic Android UI experience. I didn't realize just how intrusive TouchWiz was until it wasn't there. My Pixel 3 XL came in a white box with an Amazon Basics charger and charge cable. The cable works fine. I have not tested the charger since I use a charge station. The phone itself looks absolutely perfect. No scuffs, scratches, not even a fleck of dust on it. I was able to transfer my contacts via online back up without issue. The camera is amazing, which I realize goes without saying. A quick comment on battery life, I only lost 2% overnight with both wifi and 4G turned ON. My Note 3 will lose almost 20%-30% under similar conditions (even with the new battery that I have for it). Overall, my first impressions are very, very positive. Hopefully time will be as kind to my Pixel 3 XL as it was to my Note 3.",

            "body": "This was an Amazon renewed unit but it arrived looking like brand new. At the price I paid for it, it was a excellent value. Under $400 is the price that Google should have been selling this phone for originally. The Pixel 3 XL is a much better unit than the previous Pixel 2 XL I had owned last. It feels more solid and is faster. It would be even better if Google hadn't copied Apple's silly notch at the top. How about some originality Google? My only complaint is that Amazon only gives a 90 day warranty with their renewed products. Why so short? If the unit WAS actually renewed back up to original specs, then it should be offered with the full manufacturer warranty. Does Amazon not have any confidence in their work?",

I also noticed the phone had not been charged in 52 days (it was at 40% battery when I powered it up), which means at most someone used this phone for 4 months. I checked the sides and back and found no other damage. A $400 discount for a minor mostly cosmetic flaw was enough that I decided not to take my chances with returning it for another try. It's an awesome phone otherwise.",

I do admit that the camera on Pixel 3 is better than iPhone in most lighting situations but the lack of customer service is not worth the gamble for such an expensive phone. The software crashed after a few days of usage and the retailer refused to take responsibility for exchange or refund or repair. Google has no support in any of the 20 countries I have traveled to since purchasing the phone and their website offers no convenient solutions without shipping the phone to a service center in Singapore or US. I am not sure how Google thinks this is an efficient way to deal with software issues, but I am not the customer who can afford to be without my main phone for 6 weeks. The two year warranty they offer is as good as no warranty in my opinion and Google should not be charging these prices if they have not figured out their license problems internationally. Stay away from Google phones and make sure to spread the word so no one else experiences what I have experienced.",

            "body": "Great phone overall; however, there are two minor annoyances. There is no separate headphone jack -- everything uses the USB-C port. This means that you cannot charge the phone's battery and use headphones at the same time, since they both require the single USB port. The supplied ear buds have a USB-C connector. There is a USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone adapter, so you can use regular headphones. For what it's worth, the supplied ear buds use a slightly stiffer loop in the cable that fits inside the earlobe, which I find much more comfortable and better-retained than traditional ear buds. The back of the phone is so slippery that it will not sit in place on even a very slight (e.g., two-degree) slope without sliding off -- e.g., an open notebook in front of my computer screen. This makes a protective cover mandatory for me, which is not a problem since I have a cover.",

The phone is completely worth it the only thing I'm not completely in love with is the camera, is not bad it takes pretty good pictures but previously owned a zte axon 7 and the quality is lower on the Huawei Y9 which we don't mind honestly since this Huawei is not as expensive as the axon it is expected. But for the price is definitely a must buy we were weary of buying it because we saw a couple reviews and answers saying it might only take 2g or 3g but it received a 4g signal and everything works smoothly, we are currently using Cricket Wireless as our service provider. We had only purchased one phone to check if we like it and if it worked with Cricket and now we're ready to make another purchase because we loved it.",

I did use the help app to ask some questions about settings and got answers back within in a few hours from Huawei's help team. Overall, a great phone at a great price. BUY IT!",

A plethora of native settings to tweak the phone to suit your visual and performance needs. This is a not a Samsung Note 10! But for the features and performance at a little over $200, this \"beats the brakes off\" a phone that cost $600 more.",

It even has 64GB in internal storage who can beat that, and it's Dual Sim Card along with ability to take moving pictures. An option not available on the Huawei Y7 2019. I absolutely prefer the Huawei Y9 2019 over the Huawei Y7 2019. Your videos show clear as daylight, I'm able to stream videos at 1020p now! I wasn't able to on the Huawei Y7 2019, now I can \ud83d\ude01. I'm definitely glad I made the switch. I totally give this phone a rating of 5 stars. The processor and overall performance of this phone up there with phones that range between $500-$800. Definitely recommended individuals to purchase this beautiful device. Sidenote: I bought my Huawei Y9 2019 in the condition of Used Like New and boy this phone has no issues whatsoever or blemishes.",

The camera is not the worst but wish it was better in low light. Of course it's a budget phone but well worth money paid. Face ID sensor works great. The only downside is no nfc which means no Google pay as it is in a low of Huawei phones.... Due to security reasons which could be bogus. But overall an awesome piece of equipment. fits 2 SIM cards and excpandable storage! Huge bright and crisp display. I really like this phone!! \ud83d\ude4c",

However a huge annoyance that drops this phone to 3 stars is the bluetooth and wireless comnection are VERY poor! The bluetooth struggles to keep signal and has major interference when streaming music. The slightest turn of your head and the connection breaks up. I have tried 2 different brand new bluetooth ear pieces and both of them struggled with this phone's bluetooth system. I never had this problem with any other phone and I noticed it especially after the android 9.0 upgrade. Other then that this phone has everything I need.",

There is one thing I wish it had: file exploring via a PC. I've had to use Google Drive to download files I would like to have on it. But as far as local uploading and downloading to device from another device, I'm hardpressed to say it's there at all. Or maybe I haven't found out the trick behind it yet.

It also has a big screen and is unlocked for any carrier. You can get the phone cheaper on Alie Expressx, but I didn't because I don't trust those websites. I thought it was worth the extra money to get my new phone in a couple of days instead of a couple of weeks. I did have a Galaxy s10e and I can say that this phone is miles above that phone. Every Galaxy I have ever had had had problems cable charging and the s10e was no exception. I usually keep a phone for 4 years, but I kept that phone for 2 years. I was sick of wireless charging my phone all the time I felt very limited The OnePlus 8 I have no issues with this far and have had it for 2 months. It is worth the money, if you like androids.",

            "body": "I purchased these 2 additional phones as replacements for the current ones my sweetheart keeps destroying....over & over & over. I purchased the originals in 2009. He destroyed his 1st one (temper..temper..) in 2010. So I traided and gave him mine so he could go on a trip and be in touch if needed. On returning, that phone was run over...bummer! Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail. It's capable of internet connection if needed but that eats up minutes instantly. It has more capabilities also but being financially restricted I just keep expenses as minimal as possible. (K.I.S.S.) These are OK phones and for emergencies it takes care of that requirement. The cell service itself is normal & adequate. Yes I would recommend it to anyone as an emergency phone.",

            "body": "I got this for my mom and she's thrilled. We switched from Verizon about half a year ago to another carrier. However, due to reception issues, we switched her back to verizon, but this time prepaid. The prices for Verizon's prepaid per minute are not as great as the previous carrier, but this phone is great! It's almost identical to my mom's contract samsung phone, which lasted her years, except this phone is a little more up to date. The reception is just as great as it was with our contract phones too. It's a great basic phone, and if you told me it was a contract phone I would believe you in a second. It has a great feel to it as well. I'm very pleased.",

            "body": "This phone has a lot of functionality. It is Very small. Great for an emergency pay-as-you-go phone which is what we were looking for at the time. Totally programmable and very easy to understand and manage online. I am sure if one wanted to call Verizon to activate and ask questions about the phone and service, it would be equally satisfactory. My experience is with online activation and teaching my elderly father to use this phone in an emergency. The ring is loud enough to be heard, the speaker is loud enough to be heard and it is small and functional.",

(Yeah, I know!) When the phone arrived, I realized my error, and contacted the seller immediately. I sent the phone back pronto. But I have received only generic responses from the seller, Crawfords Superstore, to my communications. Maybe they credited my credit card ... I hope so. But I thought I would get s o m e kind of acknowledgment. Too impersonal. Maybe I am dreaming, expecting communication. Could be; doesn't impress me.",

            "body": "Thank you Samsung for guaranteeing I never buy another cell phone made by you. After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the \"wrong battery\", \"unsupported battery\", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and \"*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired.\" and in a separate email, \"Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST.\" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by \"We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST\". A week later, I got another message, \"Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing\", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA. I resurrected my Motorola with a cheap OEM battery I got online, which I will continue to use.",

The phone takes pictures also. Not the best but that is not what I purchased the phone for. This phone has all that I need to communicate with others via text or calling. I can also access GPS, the internet, my emails, look up restraunts in surrounding areas and it has many more features that I did not even know was on the phone when I purchased it. What I also love about this phone is that I text over 1000 texts a month. I only pay $20.00 a month for a text bundle. I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what. I love the Samsung Smooth with the Verizon service. Never lose a call or miss one, I can text all day long, every day for only $20.00 a month, and all of the extras that I described above. It is worth every cent that I pay for it.",

            "body": "Windows Phone 8 is the best. I have a Windows 8 PC and once I got the Nokia Lumia 822, my Windows 8 experience got better. I can transfer files with ease. With the PlayTo option I can play videos and music to any compatible device, such as my Xbox 360, and watch them on a larger screen. Plus, with 7gb of SkyDrive, I can save my photos, PDF files, etc and view them on any Windows 8 device. It also takes a micro SD card, up to 64gb, so I can store music and videos on my phone as well and save my phone's internal storage for the apps I install on it. I sometimes feel like I'm in Star Trek TNG with the way it all works together. Now when I see Lt. Commander Data with his data pad, I keep looking at it to see if he's on Facebook. Windows 8, Windows 8 RT and Windows Phone 8 is truly TNG. I like the Family Room option a lot, too. My brother and my sister's fiancee also use Windows Phone 8 and, even though my sister's fiancee is on another service provider, we share the Family Room to post pictures, events, and news to each other or just simply keep in touch. To truly appreciate it, you have to try it out.",

            "body": "I needed to get another phone as mine was giving me some problems. I had a Windows phone several years ago and liked it but I had a few issues with it and upgraded to an Android phone. After two android phones I thought I might try a Windows phone again with a much better operating version, Windows 8 or 8.1. I bought this phone as a \"refurbished\" unit. About two weeks after I received it the USB port failed so I had to buy a QI charging back so I could continue to use the phone (I already had a QI charger). I bought a spare battery at the time of Amazon order to make sure I had at least one good battery available. Overall the the phone had been a good buy. I have also changed to a Windows 8.1 computer some the process was a little easier using the similar OS. I follow the Windows 10 news each week, looking forward to a final public release of W10. I am not sure I will make it to the W10 release before I will want or need to upgrade again. I think Microsoft needs to speed up the release if possible. I am sure a lot of people are getting tire of waiting on a new OS, especially in the Windows Phone area. If MS will help developers port apps from Android or iPhone to Windows universal apps, that will be a good selling point for the windows Phone world. So far I am not willing to try the Windows 10 developers preview software mainly because of the broken USB port. The USB port would be needed if I needed to go back to the current 8.1 software. If you want to try Windows 8.1 this is an inexpensive way to get started.",

            "body": "Update 7/28/2014: Wow. Just wow. I just don't know where to start. I thought I really wanted this phone, coming from Android phones. It's been almost 2 years and I am still not too pleased with it. When I first got the phone last year, I realized many of the apps I'd used on my Androids weren't available yet. I'm not heavily involved with social media, but I did use Facebook, Craigslist, Noom and sometimes Pinterest. Facebook did just this month finally update their MS app, a definite improvement. Initially, there were several similar apps, but either the MS-specific ones weren't well-developed or the more generalized just didn't work well on this phone. I haven't looked lately, so perhaps there have been improvements in the others. My teenager, admittedly more knowledgeable about technology and trends than I am, offered the analogy of how iphone, android and windows phones are respectively analogous to mac, microsoft and linux computer systems. That helped. But at least he was kind enough not to call me clueless. What I like: --Hand-friendly shape and the size of the viewing area --Live tiles-can pin to the start screen any function you regularly use, tiles are easily rearranged to the size /position that best suits your needs; also, the tile colors can be changed from the garish primary colors you usually see in Nokia Windows Phone ads --Fairly simple to navigate your way through the phone/screens --Calendar and other reminders are more useful than with my Droid/google calendar --Camera takes nice images, especially in low light conditions; video is usually pretty good quality, too What I Do Not Like: --The speakers are tinny, atrocious, just terrible. With my previous phones, the sound quality was surprisingly good, which is why I started using them for more than just speakerphone calls. I know most people use headphones for calls and music, but I prefer to listen to music via speakerphone in an arm band or chest pocket when running trails. I'm usually sharing the trail with others on mountain bikes or horses, so having my ears open is just safer. Besides, by having my ears open, I, too, am open, to the possiblity of interacting with other humans around me. And I'm not blaring my music, imposing it on others. Unlike the ubiquitous private phone conversations now being carried on in any public space. --Having to set up another email account to use the phone --Nokia Music was advertised as a data-free way to listen to music, but it shuts down repeatedly and it's fairly limited in its selections anyway, so I stick with Pandora, Spotify, etc. --Many web pages, such as Craigslist and various news and literary sources, for example, do not format properly on this phone. It almost makes me dizzy to have to pan back and forth, after zooming in, to read a news article or Craigslist post, because it doesn't automatically resize when you double-tap the screen, as my old Androids did. Wow. Just wow. Thanks for letting me vent, to those of you who scanned and moved on to the next review. I hope my insight was helpful in some way. Some of us don't buy phones frequently, so we're a little more invested in researching our choices, hearing what others have to say, before we make that committment.",

            "body": "This is a great phone so far. I thought I ordered the black model but they sent it in white. I came from palm pre 2 and so far I love the Lumia. I didn't want an iphone I think they're overrated and clunky. Ive seen my sister in laws with the case on it its like half the size of my kindle. I don't carry a purse and don't want to but with something that big it wouldn't fit comfortably in my pocket. Ive had a droid x too I wasn't impressed with call quality with some calls being echoed. It also didn't have a vibrate option for all alerts which was a turn off here. I was tired of the short battery life of my pre 2 so thats already a step up Id say its average as someone else put it but still one day more than I got out of my old phone. The crisp features of the Lumia are great and receiving and or editing MS docs is a no brainer. The music option is great as you can add your favorites to your desktop. Tune in radio and Pandora are already installed. GREAT for me I'm a music person. I noticed you have to shut it down when it doesn't react like it should. Ive had to once in two weeks so no biggie. One thing I did which I think is a great idea is that for $5-6 you can buy a small case for the phone since it has a slick feel to it you might not hold onto it easily. Ive dropped mine a couple times and it hasn't cracked the screen as someone else said. Its still nice and slim too. The bigger screen is a plus from the pre2 but no real keyboard its all about touch with the Lumia. Id given it 5 stars if it had better battery life. I'm not a big gamer but I see the xbox option on the home screen and I'm sure any of the apps not updated will be soon. It was free to me with a Verizon upgrade so that's great too. After using the a couple weeks after writing this I had to order another phone. The OS didn't seem to be working properly and I want a different color.",

            "body": "I loved my Nokia Lumia 822 for about 10 months. It started giving me trouble charging. I would have to wiggle the charging plug in the phone until it would start to charge, then be very careful not to touch it until it was finished charging. After a couple of months of that, it stopped charging all together. I searched Amazon for a replacement, since I liked the phone and had a $30 Otterbox for it. It went from being an $80 phone to being like $400. I went to Ebay and found one for $100. I bought that one, Within a couple of months I started having the same problem. It would be nice if Nokia would make a fix for this so I could keep using this phone.",

In general lack of apps does suck but over this past year I have seen great improvement in apps and in OS updates which improve the phone while not slowing it down. The built is solid over the past year I have drop my phone plenty of time and the screen never cracked or has any scratches. The sides have minor scratches but the screen is what matters. OS is improving, One Note, Office apps and mailbox are great. Bulit is durable Speed is awesome regardless of how many apps you have installed or updating the OS. Size is ideal it isn't the biggest screen nor the smallest but it is the great. Camera is average but the Nokia apps help it a ton.

            "body": "I used to work at Microsoft and I can remember overhearing conversations at lunch where launch teams were laughing at how their new program was going to market with a 33% fail ratio and it was a major part of the applications that come with Windows when you get the full version. So, basically, they considered it a success that only 1 out of 3 attempts to use this software only worked. Imagine if Boeing were to adopt that sort of thinking? It would not be good. So, knowing this, I was skeptical about jumping into line to be one of the first to own a Microsoft Windows Phone. I had been an Android customer primarily for shear economics. The iPhone is a polished elegant product and they have so many great apps. The Apple product sells for so much more than, well, just about everyone else. The Android has some phones that were better than others. Some were real junk and others were very nicely done. My last phone was the Droid Incredible and I thought it lived up to its name really. It never seemed to run out of memory for tons of texts, emails, and photographs. I was pretty heavy into all of that. My phone was an extension of me, as it is with most people these days. I recently had to go 2 weeks without a phone. Can you imagine? I was constantly reaching for my Android to save the day. I wondered how high we were in mountains, I remembered my altitude app and reached for my phone. Oops, not there. I was at a garage sale and trying to communicate with someone from Russia. No worries, I had this great free app that they could speak into and it would tell me aloud what they said now in English, then I could flip the settings in reverse and answer them with confidence, but not this time. My phone was being replaced and in the mail. We jumped in the car to go for a drive and the last couple of minutes of a great old song was playing, so I grabbed my Android to use Shazam which can listen to any song for a few seconds and then tell you the name of the song, the album, the song writer, producer, and singer. It would tell you when it was produced and released, show you photos of the album cover, provide you with a link to the Artist's Webpage, and show you the best prices online and locally, based on the GPS info that your phone already had. But not that day. These smart phones in general are amazing and incredible. Can you imagine the reaction you would get a mere 100 years ago if you popped out an iphone, fully loaded with all of the best apps? They would probably have you burned for worshiping the devil or for witchcraft. The big question has been there since it all began? Should I buy an iPhone or an Android? Well, we weren't even done with that huge debate and now there is a new contender in the ring. The WINDOWS PHONE. It hit the market with all of the pizazz of a damped firecracker on a winter day. Microsoft should be ashamed of such a pathetic introduction to the world. When it was first released they didn't even have a compatible install of something as basic as Instagram. I am having Vista flashbacks, or even Windows 95. Well, it was mine and I had about 10 days to decide if I was going to keep it or send it packing back to Verizon. The lack of applications was really painful and I wondered how long it would be before MS Got it together with their beloved updates that we all detest so much on our computers. They are a necessary evil, but it would be nice if they got a little closer to getting it right to begin with. :) Looking beyond the app issue, I liked the feel of the phone. The screen was large, bright, and very clear. The software was a bit confusing since it really didn't look like anything we had ever seen on anything before. The live tiles seemed odd at first, but after a few days, I began to get it. I learned how to customize the screen and how to determine what is visible in all aspects of the phone's operations. Then there was the smoking gun. This phone had one thing that I personally hadn't had in such a long time that It frankly shocked me. This phone had a Minimum Rated Talk Time of 900 minutes and a Minimum Rated Standby Time of 480 hours or 20 DAYS. That was it for me. This brand new Windows Phone may not have had all of the bells and whistles just yet (apps), but it looked great, worked well, and had the most amazing battery life I had ever seen. It had a slow start, but the latest reviews are indicating that the sales have doubled in the last year alone and that Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s iPhone lost market share in every country reported by Kantar except Australia and Spain. I recently spoke with a Representative at Verizon who advised that the latest word from Microsoft is that they are approving approximately 100 new apps per day. They are adding them as quickly as they can screen and approve them. Its just a matter of time before they not only catch up, but possibly even dominate the market. Step aside iPhone, you may have a serious fight on your hands this time. Review by Jim Bennett, Snohomish , WA",

            "body": "I had a windows phone with at&t for about 18 mos. When I moved to Utah the at&t signal was so bad I ended up going to Verizon. When I went to Verizon last summer they had one windows phone which did not seem very good so I bought a Samsung S3. The Samsung is a really solid phone and I like it...However I missed my windows phone so I purchased an 822 on Ebay. I have been using the phone for the past 3 months. I personally like the 822 much better than the S3 because.. The 822 is a bit smaller and it is easier to hold. I get much better battery life Windows phones are infinitely easier to use. I prefer one long page to 5 pages. Fits in my pocket better. I have 4 emails and I can set icons for each on the screen I love the new small/large icon setup. I love the history tab on each contact. I hate having to dig up emails from months ago..flip to the person who sent it and go to history and there it is. You cannot go wrong with either the S3 or the 822. It all comes down to personal preference. One thing I love about Verizon is that you just pop out your sim card and put it in your other phone and your good. You could not do that at at&t when I was with them. I did try my S3 a week ago just to see how the experience was....I was back to my 822 in a few days.",

            "body": "Update 9/22/13: I am on my 4th Lumia 822 and it works perfectly. Not sure if it's because it's a different phone, or if they fixed the underlying issue, but I am now a happy camper! Old review: DON'T buy this phone if you need your phone to stay on. I bought the Nokia Lumia 822 after having another Nokia phone for about 7 years. It was durable and easy to use, and I never had any problems with it. But I've had problems with the 822 since day 1. It randomly shuts itself off and stays off. The first time it happened, I was late for work because the alarm doesn't work if the phone is off. This happens every 2 nights or so. It also happens during the day. One time, it shut off 3 times within a couple of hours. I couldn't power the phone back on except by taking the back off, removing the battery, counting to 10, and then putting the battery back in. Yesterday, I learned that you can also hold the \"volume down\" button at the same time you hold the power button, and you have to hold them both until it powers back on, about 12 seconds. Better than taking the battery out, because when you remove the back of the phone, sometimes several times a day, the back gets loose. I reported the problem immediately to Verizon, and they told me to keep the phone because they were expecting a software update by the end of the following month that would fix it. So I kept it, but when the next month went by and the phone was still not working, I called back to ask what had happened. They said this is a known issue, and they didn't know when it would be fixed. So I asked them to send me a new phone and they agreed to do so, but it was only when we talked about it some more that I found out they were sending me a refurbished phone. I explained that I reported the problem within the 14 day time limit, so I expected a new phone. They said it didn't matter, all they could send me was a refurbished phone. When I got the refurbished \"phone\", they only sent the front half of the phone. You have to use the old battery, SIM card, and phone back. On this phone, we couldn't even get it set up because of error messages, so I returned that the next day. I'm on my third phone now, and it also shuts off. I powered it on for the first time yesterday around noon, and it shut off by 2:00 PM. It shut off last night during the late evening hours, and it shut off again during the night. My recommendations: 1) don't buy this phone, 2) if you get a phone with a problem and Verizon tells you a software update will fix it soon, don't believe them, and 3) if you have ANY problems with a new phone, don't let them talk you into keeping it - return it ASAP and get a new one.",

            "body": "I purchased a grey 822 from the Verizon store on November 9th (sorry, Amazon - couldn't find it on your site). Nonetheless - this phone has some excellent features, and a few nits. Pro: As has been mentioned, the screen is nice. Surprisingly, you can read it outdoors although direct sunlight reduces visibility somewhat. Pro: Real, honest-to-God Microsoft Office applications - not knockoffs. I've even edited Powerpoint presentations on the way to meetings, with no problems. Pro: RF. I have owned cellular phones, both dumb and smart, since 1992. Sometimes the radios are good, and sometimes you can't hold onto a session to save your life. Out of all the smartphones I've used (including Motorola, who normally makes great radios), this has one of the best. I get reception in places my wife's feature phone can't even pick up one RSSI bar and my older iPhone 4 can't get any reception at all. A fine radio. Can't wait to try it out overseas and see how the HSPA radio works! Pro: Bluetooth 3.0. Very good performance with all my BT devices (including my boat's BT navigation equipment). Con: Bluetooth profiles missing. Why, oh why, didn't Nokia include the HID profile? iPhone and the higher-end Android phones have it, and it's really handy to be able to whip out a BT keyboard to edit some documents. Con: So, Microsoft - where the heck is VPN support? This is easily the biggest complaint I have. I NEED VPN support to connect to machines in my office and monitor builds, perform IT support etc. As it is, I have to kludge by with using WiFi connection sharing and hooking through with my laptop, which is slow and lame and uses up my precious GBs. I have heard rumors that MSFT may include it in Apollo+ (or WP8.1 or whatever they're calling it). We'll just have to wait and see, but that was a big mistake, IMHO. Pro: I concur with previous reviewers on the Nokia apps. They are, for the most part, excellent - especially the \"offline map\" mode in the Drive and Maps applications. Tested by driving all over the lower mainland (British Columbia, Canada for those of you who don't know it), in offline mode and never got lost. Con: Another nit is the lack of connection between the Favorites in the Maps application and the Drive application. One would think you could store a Maps fave and have it show up in the Drive app, but no dice. I had to do everything twice. Annoying. Pro: Audio quality, especially over A2DP (stereo Bluetooth) connection. I play through my BT-enabled receiver and it sounds awesome - especially high-quality rips of discs I own. Who needs an iPod or other player anymore? Summary - a little over one month in, I still like this phone very much and find it a lot easier to use than Android and generally smoother flow than Apple's iOS. If any of you are software folks, you'd appreciate that this OS's design seems to have taken a lesson from this book\u00a0The Inmates Are Running the Asylum\u00a0- almost all of my most common tasks are very easy to accomplish with very few gestures/keystrokes. All in all, very satisfied with this device.",

It also seems to be durable, having dropped it twice while standing. Both times the battery and cover flew off but putting it back together it worked fine. I would subtract a half star for thickness and weight if possible. Additionally the screen is bright and clear and the camera works great under most conditions, lacking a bit in low light as most small digital cameras seem to. Battery - twice since I've owned it I've run out of battery during the day after quite a bit of game playing/web surfing so that seems good to me. Haven't experienced any functionality problems. Highly recommend the phone.",

Pretty sure extended life battery will fit in an Otterbox case. Now for the cons: There are a limited number of apps at the moment. So far - the only app I have not been able to get that I wanted was the Nook app (although it seems like it will be coming any time now). Furthermore - I think the app dev's will come once more people pick up this phone. Battery life on this puppy (without using the battery saver) is about one to two days depending on your usage of the music streaming, etc. Although, I am NOT using the extended life battery - so that would probably significantly improve. TL: DR -- really nice lookin, easy to use phone; not alot of apps right now & battery life can be short. Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons imo.",

            "body": "I picked up the Nokia Lumia 822 last week and so far I absolutely love this phone. Hardware: Overall--outstanding. Rock solid construction--it feels substantial and well-made. Screen--crystal clear, smooth animation, vivid colors. Camera--I'm not a heavy camera user, but in the few pictures I've taken the camera has worked well, even in low light. Phone--During calls, earpiece audio is clear. Folks I am speaking with say I sound much clearer than my previous phone. Size--the right size for me at a 4.3 inch screen. I don't want anything larger than this because it gets too large to fit comfortably in my pocket. Battery Life--good. I keep most of my apps from running in the background and I can get 2 days out of it. Other users who keep more apps running will likely get one day from the battery. Software/Ecosystem: Windows Phone 8 is awesome. The level of integration between the phone OS, Microsoft Office (including Outlook), apps, Facebook etc., and hardware is outstanding. A great example of this is the People Hub. From one live tile, I can access any of my contacts, whether they are contacts through Facebook, Outlook (from work), Skype, or just a regular contact on my phone--they are all in the People Hub. If I pull someone up, I have several options--I can call them, text them, email them, write on their Facebook Wall, call them on Skype, get directions to their house, etc. The phone pulls in all this information automatically from all of its sources (Facebook, Skype, etc.) so I don't have to spend hours assembling the information myself. Rather than opening up a specific app to do a specific thing, all I need to do is pull up my contact in the People Hub. This is a simple example, but it's one of many innovative features on Windows Phone. One final note--the phone is great for work because it has Microsoft Office & Outlook. I can sync Outlook on my phone with my work email server so that I can easily stay on top of things at the office, without having to rely on a third party app written by a no-name company. I can easily edit Office documents on my phone and sync them to SkyDrive so they are immediately available on all my devices (work computer, personal computer, tablet), all integrated into the phone out of the box. The app selection is somewhat limited compared to iOS & Android, but I haven't had any trouble finding most of the stuff I need. I imagine the app selection will continue to improve once Windows 8 has been out for several months. Folks who are skeptical of Windows Phone 8 should just do one thing--give it a try. The more you use it, the more you discover how good it really is.",

            "body": "I was concerned about switching from my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus). I thought I would miss my apps and the Google ecosystem. I don't. Even though there aren't a lot of apps yet, there are enough to keep you well connected to your community. My whole reason for changing my phone was the bad battery life of the Galaxy Nexus. I was surprises at how much longer the battery lasts in 822, well at least at the beginning. So how long is it lasting? Well I took a trip to Disneyland with the kids... taking lots of pictures, using the theme park app, and checking in on foursquare. The phone outlasted my wife's iPhone 5, lasting 16 hours before I decided to charge it. It still had charge. I don't know if this attributed to the phone or the OS. I really liked Android, but I find Windows Phone 8 to be plain beautiful and simple to use. I have completely converted over WP 8; and there is no looking back. Love this phone.",

            "body": "I just switched to the Nokia 822 from the HTC Trophy. Many in the store were getting the HTC 8X, I think because it seems like a Nokia 920 (only on AT&T for now). I did lots of research on both the 822 and the 8X and I kept coming back to the 822. This phone is wonderful! The screen is so easy on the eyes, everything is so clear. The Camera is very good. The screen response is spot on. The Nokia FREE apps are fabulous (Nokia Drive, Nokia Maps, Nokia City Lens, Nokia Music and more). Not sure if Verizon, MS or Nokia added this, but FINALLY you can change the font size in text/messaging, people, email and more. You can also \"magnify\" the screen. (See \"ease of access\" in the Settings area). The only negative I have found with this phone, is the hard edge where your ear touches the phone. I am already adapting to that.",

            "body": "I read all the reviews and was excited to purchase this phone for my daughter for use on the Verizon 4GLTE Network, normally 3 bars of 4G reception. After 2 weeks we sent it back due to poor battery consumption and exchanged it for a Motorola Razr M. All the nice features and functions are of little use if you have to continually charge the battery even when the phone is barely used and the applications are turned off. Very disappointed in the Nokia 822. My fault for not doing better research and finding the Nokia site with the long list of negative customer feedback about poor battery consumption and the lame excuses and fixes offered up by Nokia such as disabling desirable applications. After 1 week with the Motorola Razr M, my daughter couldn't be more pleased and has none of the battery consumption issues previously experienced with the Nokia 822. Amazon Wireless made the exchange process very easy, however, we did have to pay full price for the RAZR M and Amazon Wireless had it overnighted to us and also picked up the tab for returning the Nokia. Upon return of the Nokia, we were credited for the cost of the RAZR M. Thanks Amazon Wireless!",

Unfortunately, after only 5 weeks I dropped the phone and it cracked the glass. I can still use it, but, and here is my problem, there are no parts readily available to get it fixed. Both Nokia and Verizon were unable to help except to direct me to a single repair shop (not local) which would take 5 to 10 days, (not including shipping time) to have fixed. If I could do this over again, I would avoid a phone that isn't this new on the market, especially for someone who needs their phone and can't be without it for 2 weeks.",

            "body": "WARNING Verizon has altered Windows Phone 8 and requires you to pay $2.99/month for Visual Voicemail. This ends up being a hidden penalty of $71.76 over the two year contract per phone. I have had windows phones on AT&T and T-Mobile and neither charge for Visual Voicemail. If AT&T or T-Mobile coverage is good in your area, I would highly recommend going with them instead of Verizon who alters the phone operating system to stick you with hidden costs. I have two Lumia 822 phones, and enabling Visual Voicemail will cost me $143.52 extra compared to T-Mobile or AT&T. When purchasing the phones I asked the store sales person about Visual Voicemail and he indicated it was free. I called support once I found out it costs and they were of no help. Shame on Verizon, perhaps I should have stuck with AT&T and my Lumia 920. The Lumia 920 was an awesome phone, the only issue was I had poor LTE service at my house.",

            "title_review": "Lumia 822 In Depth",
            "body": "The Nokia Lumia 822 from Verizon is an excellent choice for Verizon customers looking to move to a Windows Phone. ASTHETICS I'll start off with the asthetics of this phone. This phone is much more attractive then the photos make it appear to be. PLASTIC - The plastic is sturdy and thick with a high quality fit and finish to it. The black and grey is a flat finish while the white is glossy. It is a plastic with no grip coating and a nice textured look. It does not have the rubbery looking finish as seen on the 8X. For the White glossy finish it however takes a hit in the quality department. The glossy finish gives off a cheap look and feel. It's sad because I was really gunning to get it in white until I saw it. The back cover uses a snap on clip system that hold firmly and does not flex without moderate force. The back cover features NFC but the WIRELESS CHARGING IS NOT INCLUDED. A new cover is required. FEEL - The sides of the phone have and inward slant from bottom to top which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maintain a firm grip.The phone uses a wider display then you see on other phones. I have big hands and it fits well into them. It feels nice weight wise. It has a little heft to it when holding it but not heavy enough to be bothersome. It feels durable but it a little thick. If you like the iPhone 5 for it's size then this will surely let you down. BUTTONS - The buttons are located on the right side and are thin. They have a firm placement and a nice click to them. The click isn't loud but it makes for an excellent feel. The power button is placed perfectly for your right thumb, I however am left handed and I find it a little more difficult to press.The Photo button is a 2 stage button. It takes a little getting used to as the second stage feels muddy and firmer then the size of the button leads on to be. GLASS - The glass uses an edge to edge front with the exception of the plastic on the bottom portion of the phone. The bezel around the glass is very slight with no gaps. It sports a nice solid black surrounding the display with very responsive touch buttons below. HARDWARE DISPLAY - The display is a 480x800 AMOLED Gorilla glass 2 display. Don't let the resolution fool you though. The screen is bright and the colors pop nicely. I found it to look much better than the 8X display. When the display is turned off or is showing black it blends in with the bezel and looks great. The display sesitivity is great and features an ultra sensitive capacitive touchscreen that works with gloves on although your experience will depend on the gloves. Thicker leather gloves do not work. The touch buttons are just as responsive. PHONE- Phone calls are crystal clear and other callers hear me perfectly. Easily the highest performing phone I've ever owned smartphone wise. The speakerphone is loud and clear as well. The reception on this phone is great as well recieving a reliable signal in even the most problematic areas. CAMERA - This camera is amazing, for the most part. Low light shots come out great with the extreme flash good enough to take a good photo in a blacked out room. it does however suffer from oversaturation and sometimes the white balance just does not work out so well. I think it's more of a software issue and I expect the problems to be resolved in future updates. Nokia exclusive software includes Creative studio for photo editing and Cinemagraph to make animated photos. I took a picure with my daughter moving round in front of a mirror and edited it so she was standing still and just the reflection was moving. Everyone loves it. It outpaces my iphone in every way imaginable. The front camera stays on average grounds however. AUDIO - It features a mono speaker located on the bottom left of the phone. It's really loud but it suffers from a tinny sound. I could hear this thing from across the house though. The earpiece however sounde great and has excellent balance to it. I can hear people even in a noisy room. the headphone jack is on the top right of the phone and features features audio processing from Dolby to include an EQ and \"Dolby Headphone\". Dolby headphone would be best described as the equivelant of the Beats Audio software. It boosts some frequencies and thats about it. It helped out my high ohm headphones out a little bit but is not a replacement for a hardware amplifier. BATTERY - The battery is average and nothing to write home about. I use my phone moderately and it gives me about 16-17 hours on a charge. It stays at the 100% mark for about 2 hours and slowly rolls down hill after that. It is nice having the removable battery though. This includes talking, web surfing, apps, games, photos, texting, ect. MEMORY - 16GB on board memory provides about 12GB of free space after a hard reset is performed (deletes all of the downloaded maps from Nokia Drive). You can then download only the areas you need from Nokia Drive. It also sports an internal SD slot and the battery has to be removed to insert/remove the card. Apps cannot be stored on it. CPU/RAM - This phone has all of the same core hardware specification as every other windows Phone currently available in the U.S. The lower resolution display frees up some memory though and enables the OS to be zippier. SOFTWARE APPLICATION EXCLUSIVES - One thing you get with Nokia is exclusive software. Nokia Drive is not on other handsets yet. It also includes a few extra \"lenses\" (photo apps) such as the aformentioned cinemagraph, Panorama, and smart shoot which takes a series of pictures and then lets you replace peoples faces until you get a shot where everyone is simling. These apps all work great and are fun to play around with. It also includes Creative Studio which is like a photoshop/Instagram filter app. It works well and holds alot of features. Other apps include ESPN, Univision, Words With Friends, Foursquare, Groupon, Nokia City Lens and more. There are currently 32 apps exclusive to Nokia phones on the store as of this writing. OS - Windows phone 8 is a whole new review, I came from the iPhone and I love it. There are enough note worthy apps available to keep me comfortable and the operating system holds enough features to be more then usable on a daily basis. It has it's fall backs but there is nothing to make me run for the hills. I can say that it runs like a champ on this phone. No stuttering, slow loading times, or crashes have happened on this phone. It outpaces my iPhones performance enough to make me go wow. The Verizon exclusive (for now) Data Sense software works great and tracks your data usage and breaks it down to Cellular/Wifi and each app usage and resets whenever you want it to. APP STORE - It's got alot of junk, but if you sift through it there is alot of cool stuff on there. Some things are slim pickings while others have a copy of a copy of a copy. It's no better then android or Apple. There are alot of big name developers announcing new titles every day. OVERALL Overall the phone is fairly attractive, solid, well designed, high quality and very usable. The only design problems I have is the power button being odd for a left hander and the 2nd stage of the camera button just not feeling quite right. The OS is fast, responsive and zippy. The phone works like a champ, The camera is a little quirky but it still is a great camera considering what you have to compete against. It's big and heafty but not quite a brick and I love that. The display is amazzzzzing even though he resolution is a little below current industry standards. Battery is good enough but could be better, I feel like I will get caught with my pants down one of these days. For 100$ you cant go wrong with this phone. It is way better quality then anything else you can find for this price and sets a standard by which every phone in its price range will need to improve to outpace it. If your looking into a windows phone This will surely not disapoint unless you really cant settle for the lower resolution display.",

            "body": "I manage mobile devices for a corporation in Rhode Island, USA and chose the Nokia Lumia 822 when we switched our account over to Verizon. I couldn't be happier. I previously had an HTC HD7 from T-Mobile, and here some some of my observations: - The AMOLED screen on this device is superb and quite possibly one of the best smartphone screens I've ever used. It is made of Gorilla Glass 2 and easily adjusts brightness to ambient light surroundings, keeping the colors sharp and bright whether in sunlight or in a dark room. Don't be turned off by the lower resolution of the 822 - it didn't make any sort of difference to me. Also, it is true that this screen features Nokia's high-sensitivity glass augmentation that allows it to be used with gloves. I can successfully choose music, tap on tiles, and even text without unnecessary effort. - Compared to my 1ghz HD7 running Windows Phone 7, this device is incredibly quick. WP7 was not a laggy operating system by any means, but the 1.5ghz dual-core in this device plus WP8 is a dramatic change. I have experienced absolutely no lag, whether I am switching apps, opening apps (the splash screens for most apps appear for less than a second, even with some video games). Alot of this is due to the OS itself: WP7 was built on Windows CE which had its own hardware and coding limits. WP8 shares the Windows 8 kernel for maximum hardware compatibility and optimization. I'll leave reviews of the actual Phone 8 OS to the rest of the Internet.... but it is elegant, beautiful, fast, capable, and very very under-appreciated in the marketplace. I believe this'll change, and am recommending my company to deploy Windows Phone 8.",

            "body": "I moved to a Lumia 822 Windows Phone after having had a first generation Droid for several years. I was happy with my Droid and it worked well, but after it finally started to degrade it was time to move to a new phone. I decided to try the Windows phone platform for no reason other than wanting something different, and of the options available to me I was most impressed with the Lumia 822. I wish I had made this switch a while ago... The Lumia is a larger phone than my original Droid, and I was a little apprehensive when I bought it because of this. My concern was that it would be bulky and would be cumbersome to use, but this has not been the case. It fits almost perfectly in a pants pocket and it is just the right size when in operation for comfortable talk. It is large enough to allow for talking into the actual receiver instead of relying on the way someone holds the phone which means consistent sound clarity for the person on the other end. Call quality has been great. So far I have had no issues with the ability to speak and be heard in a call. In fact, when switching between speaker phone and regular calling mode the person on the other end has said that they cannot always tell the difference. This was an unexpected bonus - most phones I have used do not work as well as speaker phones. It is important to understand that this phone does not have a standard physical QWERTY keyboard but instead has a virtual keyboard that it displays on the screen. This is becoming the norm anymore, though I personally prefer having a phone that has a physical fly-out keyboard. In use, the keyboard works fairly well though I have occasional issues with tapping the right keys as I have larger fingers which means that sometimes the phone registers the wrong button pressed. This is more the exception than the rule but it happens often enough to merit attention - if you have larger hands, be aware that typing can get a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The greatest difficulty I have had with this phone is when using it with the car. I have a Ford Focus with full Sync system, and my Droid worked flawlessly with it. The Lumia works almost as well, though I have had the same problem many have had - when making an outbound call the system can shift into privacy mode and no one on either end hears anything. I have found that by using the phone to dial instead of using voice or the dashboard keypad the problem can be completely avoided but this is inconvenient. Recently my phone downloaded a large update and since then it seems to be working more consistently - time will tell if this has truly fixed the issue, but for now I have an acceptable workaround. Now, about Windows 8 on the phone... I am not a huge fan of Windows on the normal (non-touchscreen) computer, but on a touchscreen phone it seems like this is the way a phone should work. The Windows phone OS is very intuitive, easy to use and it just works. I love the tile-based screens. With my Droid I occasionally had issues where I somehow scrolled to a different screen and got icons messed up because of it; I have not had any issues of that kind with the Windows OS and so far am absolutely pleased. The one drawback I have with the platform is that once in a great while the phone will simply reboot without warning - never during a call (so far) but always unexpected. To be fair, I had the same problem with Android at about the same frequency, but it still needs to be mentioned. As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the number of apps in the online store is small compared to the quantity of apps in the Android or iPhone store. So far I have had no problem finding applications to suit my needs. There are more applications being added all the time but the problem is that the market share does not favor the Windows phone. The biggest targets are Android and iOS and that is where the majority of the applications are found right now. There is one application that I have been unable to find that I think is sorely needed - a reputable security suite. As I write this I have found none at all. I have looked at Norton and Kaspersky in particular for applications of this type and they do not support Windows 8 on the phone. To me, this is a big deal. There are partial solutions in the store but so far I have not found an antivirus or anything else that would be termed good mobile security. I do sincerely hope this is corrected soon. This is not a shortcoming of the phone itself; rather, it is a reflection of the Windows 8 mobile market share. The Lumia 822 is not without its quirks and issues but overall it is a very nice phone. It has a good feature set, it is easy to use and it's the right size for me. When it eventually dies, I will likely get something similar.",

I'm a Windows Phone convert - the OS is smooth, reliable (absolutely zero issues in all the years I've had it), intuitive, and exceptionally easy to use. The Lumia cameras specifically are fantastic - great resolution, and videos are crisp and clear. The Lumia Camera app (free) is definitely worth downloading as well, if you like to adjust ISO/white balance/etc while snapping pics. This thing is so sturdy I stopped putting a case on it, and the screen is STILL pristine, despite dropping it constantly and leaving it in my bag to rattle around with my keys. Only thing I've ever done is replace the battery after several years of battery abuse on my part (I highly recommend buying the OEM version if you do so, got one on Amazon for super cheap and it's been great). It fits nicely in a pocket and your hand, and screen is nice resolution and large enough to view even dense web pages comfortably. Important note - it turns out you can use the Verizon-branded Lumia 822 with ATT, and likely other carriers, by inserting your carrier sim card and simply manually changing the internet APN settings (ATT has an APN settings guide on their support pages for this very reason, others probably do as well). Took about 20 seconds, and voila. Yay! Mentioning this, because I was crushed when I thought I couldn't use this phone after a carrier switch!",

            "body": "Basaed on reviews and confidence in Nokia, I switched from a Motorolla Droid 2 Global, which I liked, to the Nokia Lumia 822. Here are some of the main reasons why I am delighted with that decision after having a chance to use the phone: The Lumia 822 camera is excellent; the video and photos are clearer and the lighting more natural than the droid's camera and any smartphone I've seen. The Lumia music features are amazing. Not only can you sink all of you ITunes material with the Lumia device, Nokia provides a free no-add Pandora-like service. Moreover, I've downloaded an app \"Amazing Music,\" which allows you to stream and store quick links to entire albums. Nokia/Lumia's driving and mapping services are rated as the world's best. Though I haven't taken a road trip yet, I tested it with my commute to work, which involves walking and taking the metro: It was incredibly accurate and even told me the stops in between the one I needed. The homepage is incredible. The Windows operating system lets you customize the location and prominence of your apps, and let's you pick a few for live constant updates. For example, when you \"pin\" your contact to the front page (or further down), you see his or her facebook, twitter, or linked-in updates displayed overtop the app. So, you don't even need to log into Facebook to see what your closest friends and family are posting. Indeed, the Facebook and twitter synching is the best I've ever seen. It takes seconds to take a photo, post it on Facebook, and tag your friends. It even remembers your recently used tags. It also shows pictures you were tagged in as a banner as you scroll and read upadates, which you can change if you want. Another plus is that Microsoft office is readily available, so you can edit Word documents and Excel documents, which is very useful for work. It also has a family room app that allows you to sink to-do lists, grocery lists, and anything else across phones and accounts with anyone who has a facebook, hotmail, or MSN account, or wants to create one for free. The keyboard is my only complaint, since I have big thumbs. I moved from the slideout QWERTY from Motorolla to the Iphone-like keyboard here. Still, it is larger, I believe, than the iphone board when you turn it sideways (it has a very wide screen), and the word suggestion tool is very good. I'm getting better at. The app store is a minor issue too, as developers are still getting use to Microsoft's new and impressive operating system (Windows 8). Yet, there are many excellent apps, and almost all of the apps I used with Google's operating system are available (and often look even better), including: Public transit trip planners, Gmail, white noise, chess, YouTube, a photo editor, Wikipedia, Facebook, a flashlight, bike share services, weather channel, a public parking payment app, and The New York Times. For gamers, there are an increible number of options, including Xbox compatibility, but I don't play games other than chess. Overall, these issues are minor. The best part of the phone is its elegance and beauty. The image, picture, and video quality are the best I've ever seen, and the tile colors can be easily changed to your mood or preferences. The conversation and sound quality is also superb. It is easily one of the best phones on the market and is roughly half the price. I highly recommend it.",

            "body": "The 822 is overall a solid phone. The screen looks great, and while it's not as high of a resolution as some other phones are, it still looks excellent, and video looks really good on it. Call quality is good. The speaker for music isn't that great, but it gets the job done. The phone is built well, and it's survived a few drops. I love the fact that it has a microSD card slot and a removable battery. I have a 64GB card in it with plenty of videos and music on it. Currently you cannot have apps on the microSD, which is a bummer, but not a huge deal. As far as the OS, WP8 is awesome. It's beautiful, super fast, and has a lot of cool things built in. It is currently missing some features, but it is expected that Microsoft will add many wanted features with future updates. The live tiles are awesome, I couldn't imagine a phone without them now. The one thing I do miss is the ability to sync with Zune (WP7 had this ability), which, in my opinion, is the best syncing software out there. Hopefully Microsoft will add the ability back as many people have cried out for its return. So overall the phone is great. I do recommend it, but do know that there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android, though they are getting there, and most popular apps are already available.",

            "body": "As someone who is very into Andriod, I decided to go out on a limb and try out the Windows OS. I have had this phone for about a year now. I am not going to lie, I am pretty disappointed by the phone and the operating system. but it works alright for what it is. PHONE: I have issues once or twice a week where the phone will shut off unexpectedly. After consistently happening for this long, I was hoping a software update would help fix the issue but it clearly has not. This leads me to believe it is a hardware issue, but the people at Verizon keep telling me it's a software issue and the next update would fix it. As far as durability, this phone is an absolute tank. I have yet to put a case on my phone (living dangerously) and I have dropped it a handful of times. There are some scratches on the corners of the plastic housing, but the screen is in perfect condition. The response time has it's ups and downs. Some times it will be lightning fast, some times it will lag a few seconds. I am always careful to kill all my tasks too. WINDOWS 8 OS: This OS looks sweet. I love the minimalistic layout and the customizability it has. In terms of function, it's kind of limited. Nokia has put out a bunch of really cool apps, like city lens and panorama. The GPS system it comes with is absolutely amazing. It beats all of my friends iPhones and Androids to crap. I would argue it rivals a legitimate GPS system for your car. But in actuality I don't use all of the stock apps to much. The live tile idea is awesome, but it rarely works how it should. They don't load properly until you open the apps, then they will update, which kind of defeats their purpose. The ideas they have going into the OS is great, but they need some optimization. App development is leagues behind Apple and Android. If you're someone who likes a lot of apps, you're going to have to rely on a bunch of 3rd party software. If you're okay with that than go ahead, but I prefer to go with the big developers. It seems like no one really makes quality apps for it. Give it a couple years, i bet it will be fine, but until then I am not going to rave about app availability. OVERALL: I will not be getting another windows phone. I would not really recommend it to anyone else unless you're more business oriented. As a college student I find Android and Apple will better suit my desires. It's not well enough developed for me to really get into it. It was well worth the try, but it's not for me.",

            "body": "I purchased this phone as an emergency backup phone should my primary (Samsung Galaxy Note II) ever need repair or be out of commission. I was able to pick one up off Ebay for roughly $140.00 and it was one of the better investments I have made. Before writing this review I will tell you a little about my tech experience: I've been with verizon for over 8 years, have used IOS, Android (current) and intermittently used Windows Phone Operating System. Each operating system (and ecosystem) has its advantages and disadvantages, as does the manufacturer. Let's begin with what the Nokia Lumia 822 has going for it. Pros: Build Quality-- The Nokia Lumia 822 is exceptionally well made. While thicker than most smartphones currently on the market, this phone feels surprisingly good in the hands. The weight is evenly distributed throughout the body of the phone, and all the necessary buttons (i.e. power, volume, and camera) are located on the right-side for easy one-handed use. The true black display is 4.3\" and is doing a well job of displaying color. This phone is readily viewable outdoors at 75% brightness, and the Gorilla Glass 2 glass panel is very durable (Though I would still recommend a SKINOMI TECH SKIN SCREEN PROTECTOR for added protection). Battery Life-- The Lumia comes with a 2100MHA battery. This is one of the largest OEM standard batteries a manufacturer can put in a phone right out of the box. (For instance, the original galaxy nexus on verizon only came with a 1800, with an extended that pushed 2100). Depending on your use the phone can last a solid 20hours of light-moderate use, and roughly 12-14 hours of heavy use (I define heavy use as video streaming). This is respectable battery duration and let's face it, most people will have a charger in the car, carry an external battery backup etc. Operating System: Windows Phone 8 Operating System is extremely user friendly. You are limited in personalization but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Live-tiles (which are re-sizeable) dominant the viewing screen and like with most functions, a single tap opens the desired program. Unlike other operating systems (i.e. android and IOS phones), windows phone provides you the ability to REMOVE BLOATWARE FROM YOUR DEVICE WITHOUT THE NEED OF ROOTING/JAILBREAKING. This, for me, is a huge plus as rooting a device generally voids your warranting at you run the risk of damaging (bricking) your phone. Manufacturer Support/Investment-- Nokia's suite of apps are simply AMAZING. You get Nokia Map/Drive and Nokia Go-Music. The Nokia Map/Drive is similar to Google Maps and Navigation. The Nokia Go-Music is a FREE music streaming service native on all Nokia smartphones. This app is similar to Pandora but unlike Pandora it is commercial free, you do not need to register, and you are allowed to download approximately ~250songs for offline use. Nokia customer/tech support is also one of the best. GLOBAL ROAMING/UNLOCKED-- One of the primary reasons I bought the lumia is that ALL WINDOWS PHONES FROM NOKIA ARE REGION-FREE SIM UNLOCKED. Meaning, so long as the carrier (other than verizon) produces the cell bands the phone's modem can pick up, you will be able to use the phone on that network. The Lumia 822 CAN BE USED ON T-MOBILE, ATT, ROGERS... and EVEN OVER SEAS. Verizon, a CDMA network, offers very few phones that are unlocked, let alone as capable of being used on GSM networks. So not only is this phone a good back-up phone, it's also a phone which can be used in case you want to switch carriers and don't want to sign a 2year contract/buy a new phone. Cons: Lack of Developer Investment-- The Windows Store has roughly 150,000 apps on the market, as compared to IOS and Google which have over 700,000. The list of apps also grows very slowly in Windows Store-- some of the more popular apps aren't available either. Lack of Mainstream Appeal-- The lack of personalization is a deterrent for some. The live tiles can get boring. >>List will be updated at a later date",

You would think that if the two greatest tech companies in the world (Nokia and Microsoft) teamed up to make a phone, it would be something of top quality but this isn't the case unfortunately. I've had so many issues with this phone that I had to call Verizon to get a new one..and the new one was EXACTLY the same..im not even going to waste my time calling them again because im so done with verizon and im done with windows phones. These phones are like this straight from the factory because of improper testing by Microsoft, improper testing by Nokia and worst of all...verizon for not intervening when its in their best interest to provide their customers with good phones..because after all....its a telecom company..thats what they do. I am dissapointed with these reviews as well..either they're fake or people just dont know how to review a product or what a review even is. You're supposed to evaluate a product thoroughly before judging it. Everything seems nice when its new but when you have it for more than a year like me then you begin to see why it deserves one single star and nothing more. I came to windows from several androids because I got tired of all the bugs and unreliability that android devices have..also the fact that the phone looked incredibly gorgeous in the store and on YouTube. I can now say this is probably the worst operating system out of all 3 (android, apple, msoft) For crying out loud they dont even have proper apps like a fully functioning browser, a non browser based YouTube app that actually works, a chat app not even a proper video chat app. Everything is garbage.. - phone shuts off at random times once a week - the microphone doesn't function when pressed against your ear and no one can hear you..because for some odd reason the mic is at the earpeace - the back cover is paper thin and the phone is hard to assemble if you need to take the sim out or access the battery compartment - GPS is literally useless unless you want to be taken to a random location you didn't ask for ( happened to me a lot of times) unfortunately nokia thought it was a good idea to block their customers from using the only functioning maps app available..which is google maps..because they have a stupid partnership with windows..so now I have to use a map app that doesn't work - Browser closes by itself..the back button doesn't take you back to the last page you've visited - phone has problems loading images in the browser - problems loading webpages - silent mode isn't silent mode at all, its vibrate mode, loud mode doesn't have the option to turn off vibration - apps close by themselves daily - phone locks up for a few seconds at a time - the app store has probably 1/10th the amount of apps that android does - contact transfer to windows live doesn't work (I've lost so many numbers after I got a replacement for this phone from Verizon - after turning flash off on the camera phone the flash still flashes - highlighting individual words isn't accurate..the phone highlights the complete sentence instead - messages sometimes dont get through - Bing sucks - battery life is really bad - the phone wasn't properly tested - this is my last windows phone On a positive note the phone is extremely rugged. You can probably drop this phone from the first floor of a building and it will still work. This phone is a mess stay away",

Only drawbacks I can see is I wish the speakerphone was better and that the battery lasted longer. Try it, you may like it. Mine was particularly appealing as it was free through Best Buy matching WalMart. Update 12/12/12-I really like this phone but the battery just does not cut it. I have everything turned off and it still drains like crazy. I am running a WPBench test on it now and may try and exchange it tomorrow. On my old iPhone 3G with my normal usage it would go 3-4 days. At best, the 822 will go one day. I am hoping this is a defective phone/battery.",

            "body": "My 3-year-old XV6800 smart phone was working fine but so obsolete that I couldn't use Wi-Fi in some locations, so it was time for a change. I spent several months considering my options and settled on the Nokia Windows 8 phone, partly because I'm a Windows user and partly because of the extra-good camera. Over the next two weeks I had a lot of problems with it, mostly software-related, so I traded it in for an Android. Whenever I get a new piece of equipment, I like to start off with the user guide in front of me so I can survey the features and be sure I understand how everything works. The introductory booklet said I could get a user guide by downloading it or by calling Nokia or Verizon . The guide was full of graphics and fancy fonts and choked up my printer so I called first Nokia and then Verizon. Both said that they would not send me a user guide. An obliging Verizon store rep finally printed one for me. I connected the phone to my Windows 7 laptop. It found the phone and gave me a link to download the necessary software. I downloaded it and tried to install it but got the following error message: \"Windows Phone requires Net framework 4.0. Please install from '[...]\" No actual link was given and the address didn't work but I managed to find the necessary page and downloaded the software. After that the laptop recognized the phone but I was not able to set up playlists using either Windows Media Player or Zune and finally gave up on that. I haven't taken the time to tackle this issue on the Android. I'm still using my old phone to play music at the gym. When I tried to get help from Nokia and Verizon they didn't seem to know what to do either. If manufacturers of hospital equipment or kitchen appliances treated their customers this way there would be lawsuits; why do we tolerate this sort of behavior in the case of tech companies? The front screen of the Nokia phone with the flipping tiles was very cute and I loved being able to make a little mini version of my blog page there but these features were not enough to compensate for the hassles. Also, after the withering review by Walter Mossberg in today's Wall Street Journal, I won't be upgrading to Windows 8 anytime soon.",

            "body": "I purchased this phone directly from a Microsoft Store based on many positive reviews. After using the phone for a couple of days, I seriously question whether the reviewers actually use this phone as their primary smartphone. I consider myself an average smartphone user, and based on the Lumia's still lacking features, I have since returned the phone. However, I would highly recommend buying products from a Microsoft Store as they are very helpful answering questions, and have a good return policy. Here are the things that I liked about this phone: * The screen is bright and crisp. * The email and calendar apps have nice features and are easy to use. * The battery life was very good. * Call quality was good. Here are the things that I did not like about the phone: * The Nokia Drive navigation app does not announce street names. It does show the names on the screen, but having to look down at the phone defeats the purpose of using voice enabled navigation. * Many websites do not recognize the phone as a mobile device, so the page is the desktop version. As such, the text does not automatically wrap across the screen. * A widely used podcast/mp3 was not recognized by the phone, so I was unable to download. * There are still quite a few popular apps that are not designed for Windows 8. In summary, if the above items were addressed, I would definitely purchase this phone.",

Not a scratch visible on the phone or a cracked place on the glass. I contacted Nokia customer service and they refused to do anything about it except to tell me to call their service center, since this phone has Gorilla glass, a gentleman commented on my review and advised me of the same, I am now convinced that this phone was defective from the factory, repair will be 143.00. this is un- acceptable , My previous phone was a Galaxy and I dropped it at least a dozen times over the 3 years I owned it, no broken glass ever. I understand glass breaks, Think twice before you buy this phone unless you never drop your phone (LOL). Oh by the way you cannot just replace the glass itself it requires the entire Display unit as it is all one unit so expect to pay big bucks to replace broken glass, Verizon offered this phone for 50 bucks /2year contract, now I understand why. I have to say otherwise it is a great phone but companies must back their products or lose their customers. I have insurance on the phone they will replace for 99.00 which I appreciate but this is really a Nokia Problem and I will never buy another Nokia product because of this.",

            "body": "I have had my phone for 1 day now. First off, this phone is only 3G network speed, not 4G or LTE. Maybe this is OK for what I need, but the first review that pops up for this phone says it is LTE. well, it isn't. it's 3G folks. My phone was new. It was made in Vietnam apparently. I am on Tmobile and was upgrading from a Galaxy S3 that was having some problems after 3 years. For the price savings (<$300) I can live with 3G. The good thing though is so far the phone reception is amazing. my previous phones have all dropped calls all the time and given distorted call quality. So far this phone is flawless as a phone. I noticed the WIFI calling feature is missing on my phone. This sucks. being able to just click a button and use WIFI for a free and perfect call in low reception area was a great feature on my S3. it is not on this phone unfortunately. I use Gmail for my contacts, so they came up automatically on the new phone once I gave it my gmail address. Then I used the samsung free smartswitch app to move everything else. Just leave the simcard in the old phone, download the app on the old phone, then connect the new phone to a WIFI and download the same app from the playstore. Then just open the app on both phones, place them adjacent to each other and tell both phones the orginal phone is an android then hit send on the old phone. 20 minutes later and the transfer is completed. Then just move the sim card and you are all done. the only thing that did not transfer is my Notes Lite app. not sure why, but it didn't. Oh, the charger that came with it is an international 2 round prong type plug, so that is useless in the USA. But I already had a dozen chargers so not an issue for me. I ordered a couple spare batteries and stand alone wall charger, plus a stretch rubber case. should be all set now. I like the phone, especially for the money. And it is unlocked, so no mandatory bloatware. Just delete stuff if you don't want it. I haven't tried the camera yet. Also noticed some strange app for the Koran on it. Simply deleted it. Rather odd, but maybe in Vietnam this is a standard app?",

            "body": "Right out of the box, the Galaxy S4 was a product with a great design, feel, and interface. The OS and features are very user-friendly and offer a great deal of customization if desired. Most of the nifty yet gimmicky features were simple to disable, leaving a smartphone with overall solid functionality and an overall solid price (given that it's now two generations old). Needless to say, I fell in love with the unlocked Galaxy S4 pretty quickly after receiving it in the mail. That is, until days later when I set up my mobile plan, popped in my SIM card, and learned that the device would not read it. With a quick Google search or two, it became increasingly evident to me that the S4 failing to read SIM cards is not just a very deep-seated issue (I think I saw 25 different solutions, none of which worked for me, as well as many others), but also a very common one for such a high-tier phone. This version was covered by a warranty (maybe U.S. only, not sure), but after reading stories of Samsung's half-baked \"solutions\" to the issue (i.e. offering to replace the motherboard so the issue can resurface several months later), I quickly decided to simply cut my losses and return the phone. While the phone I received may have been the odd lemon out of thousands of perfectly functioning S4's, I would recommend that you Google the SIM card issue with Galaxy S4's before making the decision pay for this device upfront. You may be surprised (and disappointed) by how frequently it seems to occur. This is not to say that other phones don't also have defects, but it's more than a little alarming when the defect in question disallows the phone to function as a phone. Would've easily been 4 or 5 stars without the out-of-the-box defect though.",

There was no easy way I nor the Amazon customer service rep could figure out with respect to contacting the seller. It took me going to the T-Mobile store to realize that it wouldn't work with the SIM that I currently had, so that was a bit of a nuisance. Right now I am charging the phone, a call came in, I tried to answer it, but the the phone immediately died. If you have the time to deal with these hassles, sure buy the phone, if like me, you wanted a user ready phone once you opened the box, then don't. Also, I purchased an unlocked, international friendly phone, on the side of the box it says \"American SIM Card Only: This product is only compatible with a SIM-card issued from a mobile operator within the Americas...to use SIM cards from other regions, a cumulative call over five minutes must first be made with the SIM card from American operators. If a SIM card issued from another region is used for activation, the phone may not work. In this case, the device will need to be released at the nearest Samsung service center\"...so I guess we'll just have to wait and see if this works in E. Africa.

            "body": "The phone seemed alright at first, though a little slow to boot up the camera. Gradually, however, it began to lag more and more, until recently it seems to freeze every 5-15 minutes while I'm using it. I usually wait it out, but often have to turn the screen off and wait a minute or two before it will respond to me pressing the button to turn back back on. I've only had this phone around 3 months. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if a good number of of these phones are broken. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews when purchasing. My last phone, which this was to replace, was also an s4 purchased through Amazon. However, that phone was purchased a part of a 2 year contract (not unlocked, us version). My old s4 phone worked beautifully for a little over a year (none of these lagging/freezing/slow-camera issues). Rather suddenly, the screen completely stopped working (I got the black screen of death, which is apparently not an uncommon problem with s4 phones) but it was already a month past the warranty (hence looking for a new phone. Even though that phone failed, I rather liked it and expected this phone to be the same quality; however, I've been rather disappointed. My final verdict is that this phone is still usable (for now) but certainly not worth the price, or the the time spent waiting for it to respond. I'm constantly worried that this time will be the time it stops responding completely. In my opinion, your time, money, and stress is better spent elsewhere.",

After less than a week of using the phone, it would reset every time I set the phone on a hard surface (counter, desk, coffee table, ect.) While this was frustrating, I got used to being very gentle with the phone and to set it on soft surfaces most of the time. After two months of using the phone, the camera stopped working. Each time I would open the camera application, I would receive a \"The Camera has failed\" message. After multiple troubleshooting attempts, I gave up on the camera. After three months, charging the phone became a problem as it would often fail to charge. It would repeatedly start/stop charging until it ran its battery to 0%. Often I would go to sleep with the phone charging and set my alarm only to wake up late with a dead phone. Extremely frustrating! Finally, in March of 2016, along with tons of software issues, the phone is unable to charge and does not respond to USB. Six months from delivery to DEATH! A complete flop. Doesn't even make a nice paperweight. I highly recommend avoiding this product.",

            "body": "Purchased this \"new white unlocked international\" Samsung Galaxy phone in December 2014. The phone worked fine until just recently when it started losing its battery charge quite quickly and not holding a charge. Called Samsung to see if they would honor the warranty. Samsung told me that with the serial number I provided the phone was manufactured red in color and that it was an A T&T phone and not an international version. Samsung told me they could not guarantee that this was a new phone because of the information they had and that possibly it was a used phone or perhaps a refurbished phone. In any case, Samsung would not honor the warranty. Called Amazon with this information. Amazon is going to provide a full refund as soon as I return the phone to them. Thank you Amazon!",

Had concerns about buying an International version, and sure enough -- when I had a problem with receiving group/MMS messages that Net10 couldn't help me fix, Samsung said it was because an international version isn't made to work perfectly with any one network... just to work a bit with every network. HOWEVER, the next month I called Net10 to activate a phone card and mentioned the messaging problem. The rep gave me new info to list in my settings, and the messages started working perfectly! I thank God I got in touch with the right customer rep. I've had no other problems with the phone. :)",

Even better that as cell technology continues to decrease in cost, I am not locked into any contract. This is an unlocked international 'sim' type cell. My 1st complaint it that no matter how many tech sites I go to, I still have not found the correct code to get Media Messages though texting. My other issue is that while talking on the phone, it is too sensitive and sometimes my cheek or earrings push buttons, change settings, etc when I am talking .",

After about 1 day and a half of use, the phone just stopped working, the led touch screen wouldn't work so I couldn't even unlock the phone. I called Amazon multiple times to change it for a new one, the costumer service was terrible and the only thing they would tell me is that the phone wasn't on the guarantee anymore. I only used the phone for a day and it broke for apparently no reason. When i came back to US, I took it to two specialized stores and they both said and pointed out that the phone wasn't brand new, it was used and opened before and that was probably why the touch screen wasn't working. The Samsung S4, that I bought thinking that it was new as advertised, was actually already broken and I couldn't return it because of the guarantee. What Amazon did to me was disrespectful and wrong.",

However, phone was clearly purchased from the UK -even though the seller is US based. Transitioning this phone from UK settings to US settings has been an ordeal. Even after transferring the settings I have found that the phone's ability to detect signal and pick up 4G is EXTREMELY lacking. Phone was gorgeous and new, but BEWARE! UK settings are not compatible with US networks. Even AT&T corporate could not help me to get my phone working up to US specs. UPDATE 3/36/17: Phone screen has begun to black out. Notification sounds continue, but screen is defective. Absolutely do NOT order from this vendor.",

Connectivity is not good. Dropped calls and \"no service\" episodes are frequent whereas with the 520 they were rare.",

It's built sturdy and sleek and has fantastic battery life - much better than any of my previous Android phones. The screen has beautiful color and clarity and the camera is amazing. I've seen others complain about the screen cracking easily but in my experience (and I'm pretty rough on my phones - 3 kids), this phone is a trooper. I've actually accidentally dropped my phone down the metal staircase in the back of my apartment without a case - from the second floor, more than once - and the screen sustained zero damage. There are so many options within this phone that you have to go through all of them to get the full experience of what this phone is capable of. It is fully synced up with my Windows 8 laptop and everything is automatically shared between the two which is extremely helpful to me. My favorite part is the internet sharing capability - depending on your data plan - you can share your data network with any other device. It's really helpful for me when I'm out and I need to connect my tablet to internet without having to use public wifi. I've never owned an iPhone, never will, and I was a stubborn Android convert but now that I have this phone I will never go back.",

            "body": "Product received was an international phone (UK). Although it was unlocked, it was not actually manufactured for AT&T use in the U.S. This is important to consider because you will only be able to utilize 2G/3G speeds when not on WiFi. Event attempts to change the access points did not solve the issue. The battery was nearly depleted after attempting to update the phone over the course of a few hours but that should be expected seeing it is a 3yr old phone. The phone itself was in great condition, some minor phone tweaks were not present in the updates (perhaps because it's a UK phone), but it was still what you'd hope for in the Lumia 925. Overall, great phone if you don't mind 3G speed but, if you're paying for a data plan that uses LTE, you're likely to want a device that fully meets your needs.",

I had a couple of Nokia Lumia GoPhones for about a year each & if & when this one breaks I will probably get another one because of the price (I have 3 kids under 4, don't really need an expensive phone). I also use Straight Talk for these phones, which I don't think makes a difference in it's quality. I just didn't think I would ONLY be paying more money for a camera.",

Then iPhone 4, got really slow, then Samsung Galaxy 3 Mini, liked, fun Android, then this. Like this the best. May move up to 1520 when eligible for upgrade in two years, this is limited by 16GB storage, but can always take some music off if run out of space. Ran out of space with Samsung 8GB in eight months. Put chip in, but still couldn't update certain apps. Have had a couple little glitches with this, but could always fix, or fixed themselves. Sometimes couldn't get email, in the beginning, or connect to internet. I think it has a protective function, so you don't run the battery down completely, have to hold the down volume button, and the power button for thirty seconds to get turned on again, while plugged in. Glad I got it. Nokia, and Windows. Can synch with my Windows computers. Very elegant. Nice, quality feel in the hand, with the metal edges. Got for $0.01, plus $40 upgrade fee through att with two year contract extension. One step behind current technology = lower fee. 3GS, when 4 came out, this when 1020, and 1520 are out.",

Recently bought this phone as a stop-gap between my old, dying 900 and a new Windows 10 phone this coming summer. I have not been disappointed. My only complaint is the drop of total integration in Windows 8.1 between the OS and all social media apps. This is particularly annoying since the advent of facebook messenger. So far, no issues with battery life with medium use. I am typically connected to wifi, and run multiple mail accounts and the battery will last over a day without a charge.",

            "body": "When I acquired this phone in November, 2013, I loved it. It's sleek, solid, and has a good feel. The display is very sharp and clear, the camera is excellent, and call quality is much better than my previous phones (Samsung, Motorola) and it always had better signal strength than my friends' iPhone 5's. Although the Windows OS isn't on par with Android in flexibility and availability of app's, it's sufficient for business needs, and very easy to sync with Microsoft exchange for work emails. I was very pleased with this phone-it met my needs for a business phone and I was actually recommending it to others. Unfortunately, after a little less than 3 months, it inexplicably stopped working. I could place a call, but couldn't hear the other person unless I put them on \"speaker\". I limped through the first day using the speaker and bluetooth to my car's audio, but by day 2 even that had stopped working. The phone is under warranty but I bought it at ATT, so I have to go through their warranty return process which means being without a work phone for several days. I bought a different phone to use in the interim--I'm not sure I'll switch back to the Nokia when I get it back. Very disappointed that it didn't last any longer than it did--I expected it to be more durable.",

But the screen is great and it's a fast working device. Just not for me. I gave it to my grown son. He loves it.",

            "body": "Overall experience has been good since I purchased it in late November. I use it a lot for general web browsing and email. I was a little anxious about TouchWiz with all the negative comments in press reviews but I don't find anything wrong with it (coming from htc evo 4g). Battery life has been fantastic compared to my old phone. I can go days without charging and the charger is very fast. The email app seems to work well with S/MIME email which my old phone didn't. I've toyed with the SPen some and think it will be useful with a little practice. I still use a Daytimer at work and wonder if this can replace it. Love the ability to cut and paste images and take screen shots. The ability to hand write notes should make shopping lists and memos very convenient. The SPen accessory kit was missing from the box so I'm a bit miffed about that. The phone size is good for me. Fits in my pocket fine. I can dial the phone and other basic stuff with one hand (I'm 6'1 male). I usually use two hands for email, web browsing, messaging, etc but I would on any size phone. People tell me it sounds better than my old phone. I find the white one quite classy in appearance and the build quality seems good. Unlike some press reviews, I wouldn't call it cheesy at all, plastic back or not. And its a lot nicer than a certain new fruit product which I find slippery as ice. Amazon had the best deal right after Thanksgiving (199) when it was still 299 (and sold out) in all the stores around here. Still getting periodic \"no sim card detected message\".",

So the camera is FABULOUS! I'm just starting to learn how to use the S pen but I love taking a picture of a document and then marking it up with the pen. My co-workers rely on me to handle these types of things on the go and well...this makes me look good :) I honestly don't feel like it's over sized as many fear. I love all the options I have for fonts, backgrounds, color themes, voice mail videos, fit pedometer tracker, and so much more!! It's everything I need and everything I didn't know I needed :)",

Couldn't get updates. Some apps wouldnt work. -Phone came with shoddy aftermarket charger that barely charged. If I were you I wouldnt buy a phone from these folks. But its a free country, so if you really want a bad phone you can get one if you want. Don't blame me when you are sad and mad though, thats on you buddy. UPDATE: Tried to buy again from this seller because I am an idiot. Phone has a faulty battery. FOOL ME TWICE SHAME ON YOU.",

            "title_review": "A Nearly Perfect Big Phone - But Is It A Worthy Upgrade Over Your Phone?",
            "body": "I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always \"Google it.\" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most interested in comparing it to, especially the Note 3 that it replaces, the iPhone 6 Plus, the LG G3 since it shares more than a few similarities, and even the new upcoming Note 4 Edge. Physical: * The Note 4 is basically a Note 3 - if you've held one before, then you'll feel right at home. It's just a smidge taller, narrower, thicker, and heavier. But the main thing you'll notice is the design difference. Looking at it straight down onto the screen side, you might not notice much, but set it down and view it on all sides and you'll see a much better difference. It's like having a same car but the 2015 version over the 2014 version - at first you don't see any difference, until you go up close and realize the little things that make it really stand out. First of all, Samsung has finally paid attention to its best aesthetic competitor HTC, and followed suit with a real aluminum metal chamfered edges, and not the fake aluminum of the Note 3. It looks great. View it from the top and bottom edges, and you'll see an even more striking design change and upgrade. View it from the top edge especially and you'll see what I mean. Here is the first Samsung with truly beautiful edges - I would have never thought I would say that! *The very next thing you'll notice once you turn it on is the screen. the LG G3 was the first QHD screen for America from a big company, but I can say that Samsung's AMOLED has come a long way, and is now the best on the market. The color gamut, saturation, contrast and black levels have always been great, but Samsung has also come a long way in terms of color reproduction, and especially making the screen still looking great in direct sunlight - it's only been two years since the Note 2, but Samsung has made amazing progress. QHD means 2560 x 1440 resolution - 515 ppi - and Samsung's is the brightest, clearest, and best screen on the planet right now. *Other notable improvements are: - Processor: upgraded Exynos and Snapdragon processors depending on where you buy it, upgrade GPU for you gaming aficionados. The Note 3 was one of the fastest and most powerful for its time, and is still one of the fastest phones right now(!), and yet the Note 4 is even faster! Swiping through screens, switching between apps, running a dozen apps, playing processing-intensive games, they all feel like a breeze. - Upgraded cameras: 16MP on the back, 3.7MP on the front(instead of 13MP and 2MP). You can now record video in 4K mode! - The pen/stylus is now made by Wacom, the famous stylus maker. Hardware and software improvements have made it more usable than ever. - Samsung got rid of the USB 3 charging port of the Note 3 in favor of the more universal mini-USB 2, but improvements have made it possible to charge the battery from 0%-50% in 30 minutes. The battery is 3220mAh, up from 3200 in the Note 3. Both will get you through a whole day of moderate usage with a bunch to spare. I've never had it lower than 20% remaining using it from 10am-10pm with moderate to heavy usage. What you should know if you didn't already is that the screen uses the most battery. Keep leaving it on and it will drain fast, especially if you're playing a game. Other big battery hogs are leaving your GPS radio on - even if you are not actively using it - and apps that continually access your phone - like if you set your email to instant retrieval instead of every few hours. By itself, this phone is a beast in many senses of the word. But how does it compare with the other phones, and is it a worthy buy or upgrade? In comparison with the iPhone 6 Plus: If you want a giant phone, the iPhone 6 Plus is a very intriguing option. If you're an Apple person, you're going to get this phone, that's just the truth. It has a beautiful 1080p screen(a very first for Apple), it's fast, and finally Apple has a phone that all Apple lovers who have been craving for a huge phone to have. The Apple ecosystem is still superior in terms of apps and userability. On the other hand, if you like Samsung, then you should absolutely get the Note 4. Samsung now has an almost perfect big phone, and each phone from now on will only get better. You will never regret getting this phone. If you're in the neutral, then it depends on your lifestyle. If you just want a big phone for everyday use, I personally think it's easier to use Apple phones. Everything is just right there - the learning curve is not very steep(until you get into iTunes and want to export stuff, but that's another issue). But if you want more control over your phone and you're more tech savvy, there is nothing better than the Android ecosystem - it has the best of all worlds, and for those more tech savvy, it's actually easier to use than Apple phones. As a user of both ecosystems, I can attest to this personally. In comparison with the LG G3: I wanted to include the G3 because both share the QHD-resolution screens. But the G3 is more compact, having smaller bezels and a smaller 5.5\" screen. So if you still want a big phone, but feel the Note phones were just a tad too big, then the G3 has that perfect combination. It also has one of the best screens on the market, in LCD form, has a beautiful design, and the LG quality. In comparison with the Note 4 Edge: Personally for me, there is no comparison - I'm going to get and use the Note 4 Edge as my main phone. It has a smaller 5.6\" screen, but that curve and design makes it oh so unique - it's the most unique and best-looking phone for me by far. Some will complain that with that form factor it will be very hard to have a case that can fully protect it, but so I will just be extra careful with it. In comparison with the Note 3: This might be most important comparison, because you own a Note 3. Moving from the Note 2 to Note 3 was easy for me, because my Not 2 had performance issues that my Note 3 doesn't(it would slow to a crawl when too many apps are installed/used, and when your text history is too large texting crawls to a stand still), plus the 1080p screen on the Note 3 is 10x better than the 720p Note 2's, not in just resolution, but brightness, color reproduction, sun-light legibility, etc. The differences from the Note 3 to the Note 4 is less pronounced, since at this size QHD over FHD resolution is not so pronounced - although if you put them side by side you will notice the difference. My advice is, if you resell your Note 3, then absolutely upgrade to the Note 4. If you can't, or can't upgrade and have to buy the Note 4 at full price, then I would say to wait until the Note 5. Or do what I will do, and get the Note 4 Edge. By itself, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is a definite recommendation. As an upgrade, it is still highly recommended, with caveats. I will add to the review once I have used it more.",

            "body": "I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone. I've read (p)reviews for months held out and decided against the HTC M8, LG G3 and GS5. The final competitor was the Nexus 6 (No, I have never bought into the Apple ecosystem so the Iphone wasn't an option for me). I knew he Nexus 6 was going to be the Notes best challenge to date, why? Well let me explain my reasoning for switching to a Phablet before I get into that. Skip the next two paragraphs if you're already sold on the Phablet idea. The cellphone market is saturated. Devices are begging to look all the same to me, besides a few leading specs a lot of what's out there fits the same form factor. When purchasing a phone I tried to think two years out. A few months ago I made the decision that I would embrace the wearable market. I held out for months and bought a Moto360. Why is this relevant? I see the Moto360 pairing beautifully with a phablet. After using it for 2 weeks I take my phone out of my pocket considerably less. Phablets are for power users, as a project manager the Note's large size and processing power will allow me to get work done faster in the field, but as a consumer I didn't want to dig in my pocket for every notification. Let me tell you this. The moto will make your phone experience better. It's like you broke your phone into two parts, the wearable and the powerful. I can only imaging the technological advancements of the next two years that will marry these two together even better. Back to the Nexus. Why the Note4 instead? I'm a phablet newbie, seeing that google's phone was bigger, heavier and thicker was an instant turn off. Yes true blooded android fans all seem to collectively HATE touchwiz, but I was okay with it. Also, true blooded android fans root and root often. I also hold the belief that Android L will improve touchwiz. So we have big phones and then we have googles bigger phone. Next factor, price. I am getting my Note cheaper than the sticker price of the Nexus, how? Samsung had a friends and family discount in which pre-orders were gifted up to $200 for any working phone. That's right, this little old S3 made it to the end of its life and now reduced my phones cost by almost 28%. Googles bigger, heavier and now more expensive. The last thing working against the Nexus was time. I can't get my hands on one for a month and by then the note offer would have been well over. Yes, I sacrificed true android, an easy to upgrade and silky smooth experience, but I can feel safe knowing that other rooters will be making beautiful skins for this phone as they always do. The winner for me was Samsung and the Note 4. My GS3 did so well and took a beating so Samsung has earned my respect. Pros: I use the S-Pen FAR more than I thought that I would. It's not a gimmick and is useful on Job sites or during calls. Taking notes during phonecalls allow you to reference them later on. Battery life is great and the fast charger makes up for any of the shortcomings in that department. IR Blaster is actually pretty amazing. I can control any TV within minutes. Display is beautiful. If you are interested in VR the Note can be used with a $200 device that samsung just released. Cons: None yet Sidenote: LG-G3 was competitive by spec but I didn't like the color scheme and screen display. The colors seemed washed out and I was instantly turned off by it. I kept thinking that it was too dim. The colors definitely didn't pop. PLEASE ask questions below. I take pride in my reviews and would be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Also, please press like if helpful. Happy shopping and best of luck in your decision!",

            "body": "I bought this phone after owning a Galaxy S4, and loving it for two years. I fully expected to buy the S6, but after learning there was no micro sd slot and the battery was not removable I skipped it and went to the Note. If I wanted an Apple product I would buy and Iphone! I expected the Note 4 to be the same to operate, as my Galaxy Tab is, which is the same as the S4, and I love it. But. No. It has a different set up, not intuitive, and difficult to find simple features. For instance changing the ring tone on txt msg was an exercise in research, I was shocked, didn't expect it to be so damned difficult. There are features that I loved about my S4, and fully expected from the Note 4 that are just gone or so damned hard to navigate that I can't find them. Add to these issues the update to Lollipop, which now causes force close in many app's as well as freezing. I'm very disappointed and I truly hope that Samsung get's it's act together asap!",

Taking a photo of a red hot air ballon against a crisp blue sky isnt crisp either! I dont know why. I upgraded from my Note 2 because my Note 2 had the equivalent of a blue screen of death after an auto update that neither sprint nor samsung could fix. It didnt check for space before updating and never could connect to a cell tower again. Maybe i ought research if my camera problem is standard... it sucks. I have to take 8 to 10 photos to get 1 clear photo. Sometimes. Slow to take shots Harder to swap between flash than note 2 I prefer manually selecting what kind of photo mode i am in most of the time. I want especially need to be able to select speed mode or portrait mode. Lastly i have that extra fast (upgraded towers) in my area and the spinning icon to indicate that is annoying. Attention is drawn to that which moves. I figure that will be fixed in a later update.",

            "body": "This is a great phone, but there's one real drawback the was a big surprise for me after purchase. I can no longer surf or use data while talking on the Sprint network. Why not? The Note 4 only has one radio. The Note 2 and 3 had two radios. At some time X in the future, Sprint will turn on VOIP and this will be resolved, but until that date, I will wish I hadn't \"upgraded\". Operating only one radio avoids interference and extends the battery life. More so, this won't be an issue once the network technology is upgraded to support VOIP. I suspect these are the reasons for the change. Nevertheless, it really stinks that I no longer have the functionality I've frequently used and enjoyed for 2+ years. More so, I must have read 20+ Note 4 reviews and comparisons and no one reported this drawback. If you have wifi available, then this isn't an issue, regardless of whether or not you turn on wifi calling. You can talk on the voice network and surf via wifi, or talk and surf over wifi. It's simply that Sprint doesn't yet allow VOIP on the LTE network (voice over LTE). Verizon has VOIP enabled over LTE. I'm not a user on other services, but I believe Verizon and Sprint's CDMA networks were the one's that didn't allow simultaneous talk and data. Now that Verizon's LTE network allows VOIP, this is likely only a Sprint problem. Otherwise, I love the phone. I'm differentiating my review with one star in hope that others take notice and can be aware of what they're giving up before they make the choice to \"upgrade\".",

I'd still have it but came to realize that the technology curve moves on, products either get better or replaced so on that soberting note (no pun), I upgraded to the Note 4. I'm in the early stages of learning the Note 4 so this won't be a tour de force review of what it is, can do or be. The love of the Note 2 is why I chose to go with the Note 4.

We used a sim card from a galaxy we had before, and they were able to pair it with the phone at the store. I 'm only giving this order 4/5 stars because I bought this with the \"like new\" condition and it turns out the phone had some sort of previous water damage. The rep at Sprint told me this and showed me how you could tell. Hopefully it will last.",

            "title_review": "Note 4 vs. Note 3 ....... improved but still missing somethings",
            "body": "I will write this review in comparison to last years Note 3 which I had as well. I will compare the sound, the UI, the display, and camera. 1. Sound: I have to say that the most disappointing aspect of the Note series is the sound quality. I have used the HTC one M8 HK and the iphone 6 plus and they both have better sound (quality + volume) both in the ear piece and in the speaker. As far as the sound coming from the speakers is concerned, the speakers were moved to the back as opposed to the Note 3's speakers at the bottom (which is a better placement). I am baffled by this decision. Why in the hell would speakers be put on the back of the phone? So that you can disturb people sitting in front of you as well as having to turn the volume louder just to hear sound from the phone. I understand the engineering aspect may have had to sacrifice for the design but come on, in this day and age where HTC can put speakers in the front and Apple and even Blackberry can put them on the bottom of the phone, this decision irks me the most. I'm an audiophile, so while the Note 3 had speakers at the bottom allowing me to tolerate the lack of sound quality, the Note 4 places the speakers in the back of the phone causing me to constantly either choose my iphone 6 plus or my HTC one M8. 2. The screen on this phone is pretty much the best in the industry right now, hands down. I don't want to get into specs here but the screen is top notch and color reproduction is great. With that being said, I see minimal difference between the Note 3's display when compared to the Note 4's display. I'm a stickler for details so it means something to me, but for the average phone user the difference is negligible. 3. The UI is the UI, Touch wiz. Touch wiz sucks, everyone on the surface of the earth knows this. But there are some improvements between the 3 and the 4, mainly the S pen. Samsung improved the sensitivity in the pen to where it actually feels like i'm writing with a real pen. The strokes and the line reproduction is almost exact to if one was using a real pen. If you're a Note 3 user and use the S pen a lot this is enough of a reason to switch over, if not then really I really don't see much of a difference in the UI of the Note 3 and Note 4 except maybe some minor changes to the side panel app shortcuts. Yawn. On a side note, the fingerprint sensor works pretty well despite the criticism it received. I actually get about 80 percent accuracy on it. 4. The Camera: I think the most improved part of the phone from the Note 3 to the Note 4 is the camera. I absolutely hated the Note 3's camera. It was horrible in low light situations and it could not take a clear shot, unless everything was still, for the life of the camera. The Note 4's camera on the other hand is incredible. It has drastically improved its visibility and quality of pictures in low light settings. Additionally, the optical image stabilization which is embedded in the hardware not the software, creates clear pictures even when there is movement during the shot. If I had to put a number on it, i'd say the camera is 80 percent better on the Note 4 than on the Note 3. Moreover, the best added feature in my mind is the wide angle selfie mode. My friends who have iphones and other phones were jealous that I could take such wide selfies to include many more objects/people into the front facing camera pics. Overall, the quality of the pictures in daylight are only matched by the iphone 6 plus. Overall, I really like the Note 4. I do like it better than the Note 3 because of the better camera. Furthermore, the build quality is 100 percent better than the Note 3's corny plastic design. I use the Note series because they are the best phones that can open up and have replacement batteries put into them. I basically am always juiced up and ready to go. And, I put in a 64gb micro sd card and I have enough space on my phone to do whatever I please (music, videos, pics, etc). I remember when I had the Note 2 (one of my all time favorite phones) and I was constantly getting jokes and comments about the size of the phone. Now, nobody even notices what phone I carry anymore with the Note 4. The days of the phablet sized phones being the butt of jokes are over. Thanks apple.",

I chose Samsung for the stylus, removable battery and sd card, and their longer experience with the Note series. So here are the best features: 1. Voice recognition - I am dictating most emails and texts now, big time saver. I think the performance is amazing compared to older phones. 2. Speedy processor - everything seems to load pretty fast on this phone, even with multitasking. Podcasts and Web audio don't get interrupted. 3. Big screen is a pleasure! Great for multi-window feature, also for videos and just large fonts. The keyboard is nice size with numbers on same screen as letters. 4. Stylus - I enjoy the stylus as an alternative to the finger for small buttons. Also using for cut and paste and screen shots. Not using the writing capability much yet, but it takes awhile to master all the features ! 5. Fingerprint reader is a nice convenience for screen unlock. They say Apple implementation is better but this is much more workable than the naysayers would have you believe. 6. Fast charging is a nice new capability. I am not that impressed with battery life, but the fast charging and removable battery compensate nicely. NEGATIVES 1.Speaker placement on the back is not great, as many have complained about since Note 3. Overall, I am very happy thus far. I haven't even used the camera much yet, but will update the review as I exolore further.",

            "body": "I owned the original Galaxy Note, plus I owned the Galaxy Note 2. Thus I\u2019ve been using big phones, or phablets, long before it was cool to do so. I still recall people calling my Note 1 an \u201ciPad Phone\u201d and snickering. Oh how times have changed. I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Note 4. I figured it would be everything I liked about the Note 2, plus it would be bigger, faster, with a better screen, and with a better camera. The Note 4 didn\u2019t disappoint. Here are my thoughts on the phone: \u2714 Pros: - Gorgeous, big screen. Best display on any smartphone - Fast performance - Stylus pen support - Good camera (low light not as good as the iPhone 6 Plus though) - Great battery life - Can basically replace the need for a small tablet \u2714 Cons: - Maybe a tad big for some - Pen is good only if you bother to use it - Cost more than other good options - Would have kept it if it had software like the Droid Turbo/Moto X \u2714 Bottom Line I really, really, really like the Note 4. It\u2019s really the best big phone you can buy. I prefer it to the iPhone 6 Plus, even though I also like the 6 Plus very much. The most compelling features to me is the big, gorgeous screen and the awesome battery life. I did however return the Note 4 in exchange for the Droid Turbo. The Turbo doesn\u2019t have as good a screen or as good a camera as the Note 4. The Turbo\u2019s screen is smaller. The Turbo doesn\u2019t offer pen support. I actually would recommend the Note 4 over the Droid Turbo to most people. So why did I trade the Note 4 for the Droid Turbo? Moto Apps! Once you embrace Moto Assist, Moto Voice, Moto Display, Moto Actions, and Trusted Devices, you won\u2019t use a phone that don\u2019t have these apps. While I do feel like the Note 4 is the best smartphone available, I encourage people to try the Droid Turbo or Moto X and give the Moto Apps a spin. You may also decide that you don\u2019t need the best phone.",

            "body": "Is a really nice update for the old Motorola Moto E. Nowdays on $95 used to be $130 & used to be the best phone you could get for less than $130. Now with this release of Moto E 2nd Generation you can be sure it is the best phone you could get for $120 & If you need/like LTE for $150 you could get Moto E2 version with LTE (But 4GB capacity instead of 8GB). Trust me, you wont regret getting this \"cheap\" phone. Improvements from Moto E to Moto E 2nd Gen: * New Android (From v4.4 Kitkat to v5.0 Lollipop) * More cores (From Dual to Quad) * Front Camera (Added) * Capacity (From 4GB to 8GB) * Bigger Battery (From 1980 mAH to 2390 mAH) * Larger Screen (From 4.3'' to 4.5'') Cons: * No Flash. * Only 5MB camera. * Phone & Wall Charger only, No HeadPhones nor USB cable. * Low Capacity.. Even Improved to 8GB isn't big enough (for me, since you can use ONLY like 5GB)... - I think it should be minimum 16gb.. of course you can use a microSD, but some apps wont allow you to move to the SD card & thats a problem sometimes if you've too much apps. At the end is an amazing phone, considering is only 120$ we get so much. UPDATE: After using it for almost a year everything is working fine. So if you bought one and have any kind of problems using it (sound, screen, anything) just return it and ask for a new one. Nowdays (December 2015) it only cost 90$ & 100$ with LTE (I bought at 120$ without LTE). So a pretty good option for people that need or want a smartphone with good capacities without spending too much money.. The biggest problem with this phone (besides camera <good but not great> of course better camera would increase price a lot) is the capacity <only 8GB>, with the software updates and having too many apps you'll have some capacity problems.",

            "title_review": "Excellent phone at a low price",
            "body": "Much improved from last years model on every level whether it be the larger screen, autofocus camera, larger battery or upgraded CPU. I've been a journeyman looking for the best cell phone at a reasonable price point after issues with my iphone 6 shortly after launch, and finger pointing with carrier and vendor. I decided to buy an unlocked phone - and went through a number of options from Blu, to the One Plus One. I haven't been completely satisfied until my Moto E LTE arrived Friday, which I can say is an awesome offering at an extremely low price point. I had previously used a 2014 Moto G as well, however had some performance issues and battery life was less than expected. I can happily say neither of those issues are present with the new Moto E. I use this device with AT&T and was able to simply call, provide the IMEI, and utilize my old LTE sim card to activate the service. On first reboot I did not receive LTE, the rep was able to assist in enabling the LTE service properly - this seems to be an issue of the past with AT&T and unlocked phones as the procedure was painless. LTE Performance seems pretty reasonable on par with the other two devices I tested - iPhone 6 and One Plus One - all receive roughly 30 to 32 Mbps at my current location. The LTE model ships with the new Snapdragon 410, which is 64-bit, however the Android 5.02 version the device ships with is in fact the 32-bit offering. Performance seems to be much better than the older 400 which still ships in the LTE Moto G, and Non-LTE 2015 Moto E. I assume these are more power efficient as well because I seem to be getting about 8 to 9 hours of screen on time with the device. The camera now features autofocus which I believe was not the case last year, however it is still limited to 5MP in 4:3 shots, and does not include a flash. Pictures in well lit rooms seem decent enough, don't expect this to replace a standalone camera however and you probably wont be disappointed. After 52 minutes of screen on time this morning, and 2 hours of screen on time, I am at 88% battery still which is more than reasonable. I haven't had a full day of use for work yet but will update my review with full battery impressions once I have an idea of a full day use on a charge. Call quality seems pretty good, I've only had 1 call with the integrated speaker, as I generally use a bluetooth headset with my calls. The phone is a little smaller than I expected, but coming from larger handsets I actually welcome the ability to hold the phone and type text messages with the same hand in a trouble free fashion. 2 handed operation is more difficult to hide in work meetings. I have not done much in the way of benchmarking but I did have a chance to run Antutu - i received 22,103 on my first run which is respectable but certainly not a chart topper. Daily performance seems very solid as I mentioned above however. Overall I couldn't be happier so far with my new phone, it has all the things I was looking for - great battery life, extremely stable, and fairly compact after trying out some larger phones. Pros: Great Price Point Compact Design Snapdragon 410 LTE at a low cost and simple setup with AT&T Excellent Battery Life Moto has great device support and ships with Android 5.02 Cons: 1gb RAM Low Res Display No Camera Flash",

            "body": "For many years I've been a no-contract go-phone user as my wife and I don't actually use our phones very much. We don't do enough calling or texting to warrant the expense of a monthly plan. We've never owned phones that have had mobile data. However, knowing of the advantages of a smart phone I decided it was time to get one. I first read a number of reviews to identify a relatively inexpensive one. After reading several of the reviews about this phone and it's approximately $50 price tag, I thought I'd give this one a shot. As of this writing I've owned my phone for about a month now and must say I'm very pleased with it. Since I'm around wi-fi all day long both at work and at home I don't need to use mobile data. Setup and use has been a breeze. You do have to set up an account on Google in order to access the Play Store to download apps. Every app I've downloaded has been a free one. This phone comes with a SIM card. It is a smaller SIM card than the one I had in my former (Alcatel) phone and wouldn't fit the new one, so I had to manually re-enter my phone contacts which was only a small inconvenience. I then called AT&T customer service to transfer the service from the old phone to the new one which took no more than 5 minutes each time (once for my phone, and once again for my wife's phone). TIP: Save the package the phone comes in so you can read off the numbers easily when the time comes to transfer the service to the new phone. One of the other reviews that swayed my decision stated a long battery life. I'm pleased to say that wasn't an exaggeration. I can easily go 2 or 3 days between re-charging for its 12-hour per day use. I don't regret my decision at all for selecting this phone.",

            "title_review": "Mostly Negative, but I love this phone...",
            "body": "THE PROBLEMS: I want to start this with the problems that I have been experiencing with this phone. I have had this phone for two months, I love this phone, but sometimes it annoys me. The biggest problem I have had with this phone is that the messaging feature is still glitchy with lollipop. I have the screen set to turn off after one minute. Here's what happens: I text someone, I set the phone down, the phone falls asleep, when I wake the phone up and get ready to text with the already open keyboard, it doesn't work. I can just tap the keys forever and nothing will show up on the phone. I contacted Motorola customer support about the problem and they weren't able to help me. The second problem I have noticed is that sometimes the proximity sensor will just stop working. This isn't a huge deal, I just restart the phone and the proximity sensor works again. This issue only shows up every so often, it has only happened two times thus far. The proximity sensor is also one of my favorite features of this phone. You pick it up and the phone lights up like it's happy to see you. I love that. The third problem I kind of expected. Everyone talked about how laggy this phone is. It really can be laggy at times, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining. I experience the most lag when I am checking facebook or when I have too many internet pages open. This phone also has a bit of a hard time navigating google drive, but that might be because I have a ton of documents. ****Oh, and I almost forgot the worst part... the microphone is towards the back of the phone(see photo)! The first few calls I made, everyone kept yelling that they couldn't hear me. I thought it was my service because I had just switched, but that wasn't it. I did some research online and found that a lot of people were making calls only to have someone say, \"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\" Everyone online recommended to use headphones or to cup your hand on the bottom of the phone while you talk. I have actually found my own technique. I talk to the back of my phone and smoosh my ear on the phone so I can hear. I look like an idiot while I talk to the back side of my phone, but it works. Also make sure to hold your hand on the top of the phone so that the proximity sensor turns the phone screen on/off so you can hang up when done. THE POSITIVE: Since everyone lists positives in their review and I know that I come to the comments to read the negative, I'll just quickly bullet point some of my favorite features of this phone. - it ties with your google account to give you all access to email and what not -the front facing speaker makes for okay music listening -the notifications go off without turning on the screen, which is awesome for the battery -with a daily texting usage and no other functions such as youtube or constant internet browsing, I get 2 days of use without charge -the phone doesn't come preloaded with a bunch of junk apps -NUMBERONE, 1st place, top pick is the camera function. I deleted the camera app off the home screen because all you have to do to get to the camera is twist your wrist two times quickly and BOOM, your camera is ready to shoot. MY SET UP: One last thing, I just wanted to go into the plan that I have setup on this phone. I looked into every phone that plan there is and then I saw that Cricket Wireless had been taken over by AT&T. So I checked them out and I got myself set up with no hassle to Cricket WIreless. I enter my info online, Cricket said you're all set, they sent a sim, I inserted sim and I was done. I now pay $25 per month for Unlimited Talk, Text, and no data.",

            "body": "Great battery life. That's my number one takeaway from this phone. I am a light user - a typical day is about 5 texts, 1-5 short phone calls, and maybe 30 mins of web apps. Doing that, I can use the Moto E between 3 and 5 days before it needs a charge. That's incredible. I haven't had that kind of battery life since my flip phone. There's lots more to like. The phone has been responsive, if not lightning quick. The Motorola notification screen is a real improvement over stock android. As a former Samsung user, I am very apprehensive of the junk phone manufacturers put on, but Motorola has added some genuine improvements. I like the size of the phone - I need my phone to fit in my pocket, rather than having a movie screen with me at all times. It's pretty well built, and supposedly water resistant. I haven't tested that, but it's good to know. And, at $99, it's a bargain. I use it on Ting, so the low purchase price and bills of around $25 a month make this a very affordable proposition. There are some downsides, though. There's no flash for the camera, which means no flashlight apps. For some reason, Motorola decided not to support Android past 5.1 for this phone - annoying given their previous commitment to supporting upgrades. And that's it.",

For example, we take a lot of photos and I love the fact that you can program the phone to take photos at the shake of a wrist, instead of having to touch a button, so you are always camera ready. The Left Side of the Screen is an awesome feature that I use daily to keep up on Google News, which you can customize to your liking and tastes, such weather, work and home traffic reports, and news that you care about. I also really like that this phone is based on Google and not Apple. I have Apple for everything else, but this phone has made me only want to purchase a Google phone in the future. I love the apps that are available and it is not pretentious like Apple products and my phone has been running perfectly without any glitches for three years straight. I also have all of my photos and videos automatically uploaded to my Google Photo account, which is an awesome way to back up everything to the computer with zero effort. This is just a great phone that is so user-friendly and I recommend it to anyone looking to switch phones or get a new one because everyone that has taken my advice has been super happy.",

            "body": "Okay so, I've had this phone for almost 2 years, which honestly says something all by itself about the quality and durability of the Moto e. The only reasons I recently ordered a new phone are that this one is too banged up from many drops, and I want more storage (also I just want a new phone....) THE CONS: Limited storage made worse by bloatware, but that's pretty typical; you can only download a few bigger apps and have to constantly remove pics and delete text messages to make room but what do you expect at this price Phone lags and won't update when internal memory is too full but like any phone does that Pretty crappy front camera, not too good for selfies tbh Battery feels hot sometimes if using the phone while it's plugged in but I'm probably not even supposed to do that so, Battery is internal so you can't change it out or remove it if you were so inclined THE PROS: Really inexpensive Dropped this phone probably 50 times on hard surfaces including cement and it never even turned off, tho my screen is now finally cracked in two places Dropped in a bucket of water and also once in a toilet and it never stuttered Left on dash of my truck on a hot day and it was fine Left in my truck overnight during Minnesota winter when it was like -30 and it was fine (maybe this is normal tho I dunno ???) Relatively long battery life even with running apps like YouTube (easily can go 24 hours without charging with just regular use) Runs pretty smoothly without lag as long as the memory isn't fill Battery is internal so it won't pop out if you drop the phone Apps rarely crash or need force stop Surpringly nice pics from the rear facing camera Good quality video and sound recording Good call quality Can expand memory with SD card Good for listening to music with headphones Images on screen are pretty crisp Surprisingly okay preloaded ringtones??? I know I mentioned good picture quality from the rear camera already but honestly it takes nice pics Durable as all get out, I've put this phone through hell Costs less than $100 now?? Buy this phone",

            "body": "Great phone with very little negative about the HW. Screen is fine, it is responsive, camera is ok for casual use. You probably know it does not have a flash, but what is left out of most spec lists is that it has no internal compass. So if you use it for e.g. GPS, it has no idea which way you are pointed until you start moving (really annoying when you are trying to navigate out of a parking lot in the right direction). As far as software goes, though, this phone is more p0wned than unlocked: 1) If you don't want it to use your wifi location (which implies sending your location to Google continuously), then every single time you enable the GPS it will nag you to let use it use wifi-phone-Google. And if you accidentally allow it, IT WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY OPTION TO TURN IT OFF. 2) Don't want to enable background data because you pay per MB? Hope you like the nag notification constantly at the top of your screen 3) Want to use cell data you are paying for already? Too bad, the phone will taint your tethered data so the carrier knows it is not from the phone. This is a supposed to be an UNLOCKED phone, thanks Google. (\"Don't be evil?\" To quote Steve Jobs, \"Bulls***\".) 4) This phone was supposed to support LTE band 12. Too bad, T-Mobile and Motorola conspired to have it removed with the Android 5.1 update. That's right, I paid for a phone with band 12 and they decided retroactively to disable it. I know you can fix some of these things if you root the phone, but I shouldn't have to do that with a brand new UNLOCKED phone.",

            "title_review": "Excellent budget phone",
            "body": "The phone I purchaed was a 2nd generation unlocked Moto E with LTE. Amazon was the seller and the price was $99.99 plus tax. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this phone. As a budget phone, and with major consideration given to value for money, I have rated it at 5 stars. I have included below some random thoughts on the phone. I'm on the AT&T network and live in a somewhat remote area with marginal reception. I previously used an iPhone 4S, which got a usable signal in the living room of my house, and several months ago I purchased and then returned an iPhone 6, which would not make reliable calls from anywhere in my house. Fortunately, the Moto E is marginally better than the 4S in making phone calls from my house. The call quality with the Moto E is decent. Voices sound a bit scratchy but are clear and easily understood. The volume when using both the phone's regular speaker and speakphone are quite good. The screen of the Moto E has a resolution of only 245 PPI. This concerned me, but I have found everything on the screen--including very small text--to be quite legible. When I first received the phone, it seemed sluggish. I disabled everything that might slow the phone and it now seems significantly faster. Realistically, though, you can only expect so much with a phone at this price. There was a learning curve but I generally like Android. I especially like the back, home, and running-app buttons at the bottom of the screen. This is much better than the single button at the bottom of my iPhone. The Moto E only has 8GB of storage with 5GB available when I first powered on the phone. For many people this is probably not enough. After installing all of my apps, I now have 3GB free, and I still have the option of installing an SD card if things get tight. I would like more storage but I can live with this. It's probably of no importance to most people but I really like that the phone has a flat display. This makes the installation of screen protectors simple and allows the screen protector to cover essentially the entire screen. All in all, a nice little phone.",

            "body": "I bought this straight from Motorola the day it was publicly announced, and I absolutely love this handset! While I was bummed about Youtube scaling back to 480p software wise, you can tell that the screen is actually pretty phenomenal for its class when streaming 1080p Netflix (the difference is very visible even on a qHD screen). As a daily driver, I actually prefer the Moto E 2nd Gen LTE to my ol' Nexus 5, because the battery lasts much longer, which helps the Moto E carry daily tasks out better. I *REALLY* love how the Moto E fits in my hand. To me it's definitely better feeling in the hand than an HTC One M7, especially when the M7 gets toasty. The Moto E tends to also stay relatively cool under stress, which I can't say for my One M7 and Nexus 5. But overall the Moto E feels a lot \"friendlier\" than any of the aforementioned phones, and I have a lot more peace of mind running around town or going out at night with this phone. It is by far my favorite phone to date, even when stacked against all the flagships I've owned. Pros: -way better build quality over 1st gen (the loose backplate and light leakage are absolutely gone) -4.5\" a nice form factor, exceptionally nice to use with one hand, esp with Moto ergos -excellent real world battery life due to low res screen and big battery -quick and clean vanilla UI (should get even better with 5.1) -*excellent* LTE bands for America+Canada (all of the Americas from what I understand) - getting 40-50 mbps down / 25 mbps up in my area on T-Mobile unlt'd -Snapdragon 410 actually feels faster than 400 in real world usage -bloody brilliant customer service (instant call/chat button in built in \"Help\" app) -price, obviously. (u could go with a chinese manufacturer but i guarantee you will not receive the same top notch customer service, LTE bands, best in industry software updates, or overall thoughtful design.) -microSD capacity: load this bad boy up with a 64GB/128GB puppy and get cracked out on beats or whatever u do with ur offline storage Cons: -light sensor finicky in total darkness (also the case on my Moto G 2nd Gen) [edit: this was fixed in the 5.1 update] -no HDMI out, Chromecast not currently optimized for taking advantage of superb LTE connection -no LED flash/torch Overall, a very nice phone that punches well above its weight and truly does 90% of what flagships can do for an eighth of the cost. If you want a phone for decent multitasking for daily tasks, while you're on the move, look no further. I got used to the qHD res pretty fast and for most purposes it's way more than livable, thanks to decent colors, brightness, and viewing angles. If you want to consume lots of video.. until Google gets Chromecast working with a direct LTE connection, maybe go with a Nexus 6. For the money though, this is a way smarter iPhone 4S alternative. (Recommended especially for ABG's that end up getting smashed and smashing/losing their flagship phones. Srsly idk how y'all do that to $600 phones. Just. Wai.)",

However, heating was a small concern and the phone seems to freeze on YouTube vids while sound continues. Services are lte in area's while spoty even in well towered locations were smaller devices received lte. Which is a first for me and not sure if it could be a fluke. In ending this I can't help but realize I was only ok with this product and blame all 3 parties (me/Sony/t mobile) for a bland review. Sony work on heat dispersion t mobile fix tower issues(choosing 3 g tower over 4 g cause it's close, bad android)me keep research active to better my experience in the future.",

Not unbearable but I do have concerns about the longevity of the product given how hot it gets every once in a while. The phone experience overall has been amazing, camera very solid, performance good, battery will get me through an entire day without using stamina mode, and my Good app is constantly syncing so that is impressive. Sounds quality for music is good, call quality not as strong. I would say my previous phone, Motorola Moto X 2013, had better call reception. Design, look, and feel on this phone though is top notch. Great job Sony!",

            "body": "Pros: * it looks really nice. I have received many complements for this phone from people (at least to me) * it feels very nice and it is pretty sturdy! I have dropped it many times but it still works and the screen is not shattered. Cons: * Don't buy this phone. The overheating issue is not something you can look over. It makes the phone literally unusable. Overheating causes this phone to slow down significantly to the point you want to scream. Any app that uses the CPU intensively slows down the phone. I will list the top apps that you practically can't use: 1- Camera: YOU CANNOT USE THE CAMERA more than a minute or so. It becomes very unfortunate when you are recording a rare event (let's say a concert and your camera app shuts down because the phone is overheated. You cannot trust the camera for being quick and responsive either when your phone is hot. It takes a while to load and start working. 2- Maps (navigation): navigation is a CPU heavy process. That means it no camera or any other feature of your phone while that's happening. To be fair, you can make calls but the phone works so slow that it really goes on your nerves! 3- Snapchat: Snapchat is impossible to use on this phone. even if the phone is perfectly idle, Snapchat kills your phone. It makes your phone extremely hot in in tens of seconds and becomes unresponsive until. It's not to say you can't use it at all, it's just you have wait and be patient when you are using it. so if something is happening and you want to send a quick snap of that moment, you should forget about that! Even worse, if you connect your phone to a charger and open Snapchat your phone gets hot in no time and although the charger is still connected you battery percentage keeps slowly going down. 4- Skype: it's like Snapchat but a little better. You can't really use skype and multi-task. Skype alone is very heavy on the phone.",

If you buy itbrand new, international, Amazon is kind enough to include an adapter for the phone for wherever they are shipping the device to. The phone, brand new takesa few updates that'll take take around 3 hours to finish, but once you're done, it's Marshmallow(latest Android update) heaven baby. The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks. And the heat is not a bad thing, that just means your phone is doing work.

I've always admire Sony's phones, but was disappointed they never made it to Big Red (Verizon) or Ma Bell aka Big Blue (AT&T). When my PRIV's screen cracked I decided to order a budget android. Long story short I couldn't do it and decide to see what a fairly recent Xperia would cost. MONEY WELL SPENT! I love this phone, and the fact it's unlocked is even better! No more waiting on AT&T to put their touches on an update before pushing it. This phone is beautiful...the prettiest phone I've ever owned (and I've owned alot (but never iPhones)). It's performance, so far has been on point, screen is very nice, camera is great, no heating on the back experienced after heavy usage and doing all the updates. I was able to delete/disable most of the pre-installed apps. Everyone knows Sony puts out quality and cutting edge products that are harmonious with it's Japanese roots. Unless they do something disappointing, they got a new life long Xperia phone user.",

I got the phone and it was APPARENT this was not \"quality tested.\" I buy a lot of \"refurbished products\" from Amazon and typically am very pleased. This phone would not power on (or so I thought) even after charging the battery for an hour. I removed the battery and the screen went active. I spent two hours activating the phone AND adding apps and accounts. When we put it down and the phone went to \"sleep\" the screen would not come back on. I have owned many, many Samsung phones to include the S5 , S4, S6 and an S8. The text alert would go off but the screen would not activate. Eventually realized that it was defective. ON TOP OF THAT: I bought a new Samsung Class 10 32 GB MicroSD card for this. The phone got so hot during the charging/update process that it ruined the $18 MicroSD card. Returning the phone but out for the Micro SD card. LOOK at the REVIEWS!!! This company has a 24% 1 star rating. I gambled and lost..... All in all I have loved every other Samsung phone I owned but this company OBVIOUSLY does not quality test their \"refurbished\" items.",

            "body": "I got this phone for my year abroad in Spain. I'm about 2 weeks in, and the phone's battery life is probably the main problem. I'll leave with it fully charged, and within a half hour of being out, it'll drop to about 92% - even if I'm not using the phone. It almost seems like it drops on an exponential curve, and not the favorable kind for battery life. Getting it to charge is another frustration in and of itself. Sometimes the cord works, sometimes it doesn't. It's not a normal micro-USB cord, so I can't even use a cheap replacement to test it out. Sometimes the phone will only charge if I have it sitting juuuuuussssstttt right, or if i'm physically suspending the cord in a position that somehow speaks to the phone. Like I said: frustrating. Aside from battery life, the phone lags. A lot. It seems like I can't really have more than one app open at a time if I want anything to work properly. I guess the S5 has a slightly older computer, because I never had these problems when I used an S6. Anyway, the lag is particularly frustrating when I'm trying to figure out directions in a foreign country, so the phone really isn't doing a great job for the one reason I purchased it. The camera lags a lot as well. Sometimes, the lag ruins the photo if I move the phone even 1 second after I've pressed the capture button. But, I got a DSLR for taking photos, so I'm not too bummed about this. However, it worked with the SIM card with no issues whatsoever. When I have one application open, am near a charger and outlet, and have time on my hands, the phone works great! Otherwise, it's purely OK. This is not the phone for someone who wants instant gratification. This is the phone for a patient person who probably didn't mind dial-up internet too much.",

            "body": "I am happy with this purchase. I purchased this to replace an ASUS Zen Phone with service from Straight Talk. I had a SIM using the AT&T network that I put into this phone. The phone is a Verizon phone so some mobile network settings had to be changed to make it work with the SIM card, but we did get it to work. The issue we had was that our MMS messages were coming across as single texts instead of in a single group which was driving us crazy. Especially on group texts with many people in them. After a lot of research and several setting changes later I decided to buy a Verizon SIM from Straight Talk to see if it made any difference. So far its been good. So, I would simply suggest buyers use Verizon services of some kind with this phone for sure. The SIM auto programmed this time around, and no custom settings were required. The phone itself functions just fine, but the 16 gig storage space has already been maxed a few times. Some videos and photos filled it up quickly. I did what I could to clear space but was only able to clear up about 4 gigs. We don't have a lot of apps on the phone its just that the given space offers little additional capacity. I would suggest buying a Micro SD memory card of 16 gigs or more to supplement the internal memory. The phone was in good shape, and looked brand new. I would buy this a second time if the need happened to come about again.",

            "body": "I read the reviews AFTER purchasing this phone (because I'm kinda not so bright sometimes I guess), and was initially terrified that the phone would mirror all the horror stories I read after buying. I waited in suspense for the item to arrive, and it did! Right on time! Upon coming home and finding the phone plugged in and charging (I asked my mom to set that up before I got home from school so I could mess around with it when I got home), I was surprised to find that the screen and camera both still had the covers that usually come with a brand new phone. This phone has NO cosmetic damage whatsoever! It looks, and acts brand new! As many others struggled with, I had a problem activating it with Straight Talk. The problem did not persist for long though. I called the company and activated the sim card I got from ST, and after that the talk and text part worked. I still couldn't fix the data part. During the hour I sat on hold with ST, I was able to simply look up a few different APN settings and enter them until I found one that works. I changed the carrier to AT&T in the settings, instead of Verizon, and that happened to fix part of my problem! After doing that, I found APN settings that worked for the phone until I finally got a signal for data. :D The one odd thing about this phone (and I don't know if it is the same for all phones from this seller--so don't rely solely on my word), is that after the data was working it showed an H or H+ where it would usually show the 3G or 4G symbol. However, after some research, I found that this doesn't hinder the data usage of the phone at all, it actually makes it faster, if anything. It's speeds are right between 3G and 4G speeds. :) Anyways, aside from that, I have had no other problems with the phone. :) I'm extremely happy with my purchase. After reading the 50/50 reviews, I can't tell if I was just one of the lucky ones, or if others are simply incompetent when it comes to technology.",

I can afford to buy 7 of these phones for the cost of one Galaxy 10. LET ME REPEAT FROM AN ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE. I can have the company send me 5 terrible refurbs in a row. Keep my money. Have the 6th one work fine after stealing 5 phones worth of money and still be 300 dollars ahead of buying a Galaxy 10. In my case? The phone they sent me works GREAT!

Lucky there was a person on the floor that knew Spanish.

I received a message saying that it was \"network locked\", upon bringing it to my carrier T-Mobile they informed me that the phone is an AT&T one. I will be returning this phone ASAP, hopefully, their customer service is better than whoever is illegally making this false advertisements. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOUR CARRIER IS GSM!!!",

            "body": "After having this phone for a while I honestly regret buying this used, even if it is \"certified refurbished\". It comes down to the phone that I got having issues that should NOT pass a certification test. Two problems, 1) there is horrible screen burn in on the phone. I have tried using apps to make it better and nothing is working. It is obvious that this used to be a display phone because it has the hideous default background permanently burned into the backlight of the screen. This makes part of the screen still usable, but there will always be a distortion of the image. You can do things to minimize it, but you shouldn't have to in the 1st place. 2) the homekey button came slightly peeled. This is a KNOWN issue with gold S7s, that is CAN happen, but the fact that it ALREADY WAS is ridiculous. Not sure if the fault should be on whoever certifies these, or who sells them, but these suck. Also, minor annoyance, the box came with a cheap POS charger that spit out such little charge it was barely worth it and no headphones (no that I would expect that with a refurb, but still writing it). The only reason I haven't returned it is because I simply can't. I travel alot and do not have a permanent mailing address and if I was to get one, I would need to be without a phone for possible weeks. It seems like not enough effort when I plan to upgrade in a few months anyways.",

            "body": "I received the phone quickly and it looked to be in good condition--shiny, new, no defects or scratches. It works fine. My problem is that 1. A weird black mark appeared on the side of the screen--not big, but I obviously don't want it there. It's not dirt or aything--it's a black spot eon the screen. 2. I had the same model phone before I got this, and the camera on this seems to be less clear. The photos do not look as clear or the same quality as the ones from my last phone. For the money, the phone does the job. And with all refurbished products, there's always a chance that something won't work well. So I gueess it's an okay product for the money. Just wish the camera was better.",

Then we used my S3 to transfer contacts, photos etc. The AT&T rep even installed the screen protector which I bought at Best Buy for $25. The S7 Edge is a remarkable smartphone !",

            "body": "I originally bought the Samsung S7 Edge from BuySpry & received it on Wednesday 8-29-18. The phone worked well but after two days i noticed a white vertical line 2 inches in across the display from the right hand side of phone. Tried a factory reset but it came back. Contacted BuySpry & sent it back to them on Friday 8-31-18. I requested a replacement & to my surprise they had sent it out on 8-4-18 & i received it on Thursday 8-6-18. Received the replacement S-7 Edge & it worked well with no issues. Good performance, easy software updates good battery life. Also transferring my sim card & memory card were easy & they both were recognized quickly. I really appreciate the good customer service from BuySpry & will definetly do more business with them in the future.",

Made sense--larger surface area, larger risk of cracking. I thought I could go in informed, and do this without issue. I should've listened, though. The impact glass guards you can get for Edge models pop right off after a couple hours, making that way to guard them useless. Any case that's not industrial grade will leave the edges exposed to impact damage. I can see how Samsung wanted the Edge model to be new and trendy, because yes, the concept of the edge notifications and menus is new and different. However, notice they didn't make another after the S7 Edge. I assume it's from the realization that their idea was shot. If all you do is go on your phone and hardly out of your house, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise, I don't recommend this phone at all.",

After taking the plunge I can now say that my experience integrating this phone with Sprint was smooth and uneventful, the phone came clean and seemingly untouched, and the day to day functionality is what I would expect of a new phone. Aside from the basic shipping packaging (not important to me), the product and experience was indiscernible from my first S7 Edge (RIP) that I had purchased directly from Sprint. Highly recommended, and I would do this again (fingers crossed not too soon!).",

Ended up spending a little more money here, but I'm SO much happier. I went from an S3 to this, and granted my phone was ancient in phone standards these days, I really do love this phone. The camera is superb, the speed is light years faster. I'm happy. Also, there were no delays in getting me the phone, I almost wonder if it was new instead of refurbished based on the quality and box (bonus!), and it came with a charger, a new sim card, a sim card holder release thingy, that plug where you can transfer all of your data from your old phone to your new phone (I know, I'm super techy with my lingo...sorry for any confusion), and headphones to boot. It's like I got it from the store, only at a fraction of the cost. I'm a happy girl.",

The overall phone is nice no scratches, dings, cracks nada; i do hate the fact I lost the sim card key, but at the same time I have no plans of opening it. Now for the bad part of this, the recent and back keys DO NOT light up or light up when they want (as of now I use the home key to get out of EVERYTHING) and that is annoying b/c i know i have a bunch of apps running in the background. Overall it's a decent phone for someone who could care less about have the latest and greatest and I'll deal with using the home key until I'm ready to upgrade again.",

Then, one morning, I wake up to my phone billowing noxious smoke on my nightstand, popping, and melting into a puddle of plastic and steel. It is completely toast, and I'm not sure if I can get the sim card out. This is probably not a problem with this seller, but with Samsung S7- Edge's in general.

Included Samsung charger is the kind that charges this phone very VERY quickly, at least to some significant percentage in less than half an hour. I really like Gorilla Glass 4 it's really strong and step up from previous protections, unlikely that it even needs a screen protector, I had been carrying it around with keys touching the screen with no visible damage. Do get protective case though, as it may not be as resilient to falls as much it is to scratching the screen. Also did I mention it's waterproof? It's rated to be 3 feet underwater for half an hour. And yes I did put under stream of water for several minutes, work perfectly, but when water gets into speaker it becomes muffled (shake phone for a bit to get extra water out of speaker), and needs to dry for a while before the speaker works properly. I really prefer buying refurbished devices to save money and reduce electronics waste, so this was solid a purchase, I am very happy with it!",

They continually stick when pressed and will sometimes lock in place where you can't easily control/adjust the volume.

The S7 Edge phone is no doubt an incredible piece of technology but I fear my first purchase of a refurbished product is not going to be a good one or last as long. It arrived 3 days late with no explanation; the phone number and content transfer was very smooth but it turns out there was no SIM card so I had no phone service until I went to a Sprint store. The Sprint clerk said that the phone heated up a lot during set up and to keep an eye on it. At this point I have more confidence in the Sprint store than this seller. Edit: After a month I will say that the phone is excellent and there have been no problems.",

            "body": "I was unaware that this phone can only be used with a prepaid plan and cannot be transferred to a post paid plan until at least one month prepaid. That's my fault and so I had to return the phone. The same day, I went to the Verizon store and purchased the same model to replace my wife's old iPhone 4. I paid a lot more, but that's the way of it. My wife and I are very pleased with the J7 model. It's a very reasonable alternative to the high end Note if you aren't a gamer or worried about having the very best camera. Even though I paid full price at the Verizon store, it's a lot cheaper. I was expecting it to be slower but it matches my Note 4 for speed or comes very close for every task so far. I was pleased that it wasn't totally bogged down with useless apps. I deleted a handful but others might prefer to keep them all. I was able add apps such as Facebook, Netflix with no problems and they run well as well as some custom apps I've written. Everything works perfectly. The screen is also better than I expected. It's 5.5 inches on the diagonal - the same as my Note 4 - and way bigger than the old iPhone 4. The onscreen keyboard is actually large enough to type on with human fingers. Resolution is acceptable and the colors look fine although the Note 8 looks better. There is 16gb of memory and even after transferring in excess of 100 photographs half that is still available. There is an SD card slot so I'll be plugging another 64gb in there soon. I like the fact you can add your own SD card and replace the battery - it's one of the reasons I moved away from the iPhone. The speaker and microphone are very clear - no concerns there. The camera is better than the iPhone 4 but not as good as more expensive phones. The colors don't pop like the Note 8. There are lots of cases and accessories available on Amazon for this phone. I must thank Verizon for their excellent customer service in the store. It only took 20 minutes to complete the purchase which included activation and transferring my contacts over. She also gave me good advice on transferring the photographs over. The Verizon website made setting up voice mail very easy too. I would absolutely recommend this phone for anyone who doesn't want to pay twice as much for a leading edge phone. Just know that this particular offering is prepay only.",

            "title_review": "WARNING: You don't really get 16GB of internal storage",
            "body": "I've had the Samsung Galaxy J7 Perx for a few weeks and I'm generally pleased with it. But it has one big issue (at least for me) that I think potential buyers need to be aware of. The first thing that I noticed after booting the phone up, is that despite it being advertised as having 16GB of internal storage, the sad reality is that about half of it is taken over by both the OS & useless bloatware from both Samsung and Boost Mobile (the phone automatically downloaded apps days after activating it). So you actually have about 8GB available to you. In my case, after downloading apps that I did want on my phone (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, antivirus, updating Google apps, etc.) I ended up with only 4GB of available storage room. Which is not really a lot. Especially if you later consider downloading any games. Which can take quite a lot of space. However, this phone does allow users to move some apps/games to an external storage solution. Such as a micro SD card. Most of the games on my phone could be moved to a SD card. Which was wonderful. Still, it was a real bummer that half of the internal storage is not available to users. So buying a micro SD card is a must if you are thinking of buying this phone. Aside from that, I've had no other problem with the phone. Can make calls and texts. It's decently fast with most apps. Games run well. And it has a large battery. Which means that I don't have to keep charging my phone every 30 minutes like happened with my old phone. The screen size is about right. I enjoy watching HD movies or shows on it. The resolution is pretty good on the eyes. Games look good too. It's a good reasonably affordable phone. Aside from the internal storage issue, I'm pretty happy with it.",

            "body": "Maybe it is because I had an old HTC 3xx something model that was dog slow and had a horrible camera but this phone is amazing. Yes, it doesn't have quite as nice of a screen and resolution of a Galaxy 7 or 8 but this is a sub $200 phone and it still looks really nice. The much maligned camera confuses me. It takes very nice pictures and videos. My daughter has an iphone 5 and she steals my phone to take pictures, it is so much better. The fast octocore processors makes everything fast and responsive and the battery life is phenomenal. A few phone calls, lots of games and pictures, plus watching netflix for an hour a two and it is barely under 50% battery. I can't think of a single con, especially when factoring in the price. If I am going to be really picky, the phone takes a very long time to charge. 3-4 hours to go from 50% to 100% and that is plugged into my computers USB port. I have seen worse phones that cost twice as much.",

            "body": "I recently got this phone for father's day and I have loved it ever since. I was on contract with Verizon since they bought out Alltel, I loved their service but the prices were getting too much. I was planning to switch to prepaid when I was surprised with this phone for father's day. I had no issues going from contract to prepaid and keeping my number. Now to talk about the phone. It's a great phone, feels good in my hand and not too big not small. Videos look great on it and it takes pretty good pictures as well. I'm guessing this phone was supposed to be sort of a knockoff of th s7 but I'm not sure. While it certainly isn't as good as an s7 it's not far off. When I got mine it was already running Android 7.0. This thing has a 2ghz octa core processor which is great for gaming and streaming, ability to connect to 5ghz Wi-Fi bands, decent storage and one of the longest lasting batteries I've had in a phone. I unplugged this thing at about 11am at 100% charge and used off and on all day long checking Facebook, watching YouTube here and there I streamed a movie i downloaded from this phone to my Android t.v. for about 4 hours and played on it off and on until about 3am when I finally decided to charge it, it was at 9% battery remaining. The battery life is incredible on this phone. I highly recommend this phone to anyone.",

            "body": "All was working well until October/17 -- that's when the Visual Voicemail app hit and clobbered the battery performance! Now my battery lasts half as long as it did previously! To me, the Voicemail feature is useless -- I only give out my Google Voice number, and that service neatly handles my Voicemail needs. When I got the phone in May/17, Virgin was super helpful, and disabled the Voicemail feature for me ... all was well. Then in October, their policy changed; the Visual Voicemail App forced itself onto my device, the Voicemail feature was reactivated; thereafter my battery performance plunged! The app cannot be disabled, so the only recourse is to 'Force Stop' the app ... which it does before restarting shortly afterwards! I've switched off the Apps notifications, and relegated it to subfolder -- out of sight, out of mind -- but I want my battery back! I've tried everything suggested by their support team, but they remain adamant that the app must remain, and their Voicemail can no longer be disabled. My rating will remain at 1 star until they allow customers to disable or remove this ill mannered app!",

The operating system is a nightmare on this phone. It glitches all the time. It powers on and off on its own. It has not worked well since the day I turned it on. It freezes when I'm using my GPS and I drive a limousine for a living. The voice commands are non-existent. No matter how much I condition my voice it just doesn't register on this phone. Don't buy this phone it's really a waste of money. I really miss my Galaxy j7 2015. Other than a short lifespan battery it was a great phone. This is no upgrade to the j-7 at all.",

I have had it for a few weeks and it was a breeze to set up, a breeze to use, and is much larger that I anticipated based on the description which is great. It is just enough for my needs because I don't need a fancy iPhone. This phone will do almost the same thing as expensive phones (almost, haha). There are also tons of cool covers to choose from on Amazon. This phone is perfect for the basic cell phone user and I just cant fathom spending $1,000 on a cell phone, so take a chance on this one if you want a little upgrade. My previous phone was Samsung Galaxy 4G LTE (bare basics), so I actually feel like I have an iPhone now, haha. I have not encountered any functionality issues as reported in some of the comments, at least not as of now. It is a really great phone!!!",

This phone is fast. Everything runs smooth. The screen is bright and best of all the battery is a monster. It can last over an entire day on a single charge. Now this phone doesn't have all the little novelty things that an s series has but I personally have never used most of those things even once with my s3. It does have all the essentials for the most part and is very quick. I've never experienced any lag between menus or anything. There are only a couple things I was disappointed to find out about this phone. One it doesn't have a light sensor to adjust screen brightness on the fly and two it doesn't have a notification led on the face of the phone. I can understand the lack of a light sensor to keep costs down but really they couldn't spring for the .20 cent led? As a side note Verizon service is so much better.",

Was in a debate mentally on whether to set the S7 or S8 but didn't want to spend $500 - $600 on a phone. I had missed the Cinco Dr Mayo 15% cell on Boost Mobile Website. But I am SO GLAD AND HAPPY. I waited and decided to look on Amazon. This same phone is $149 at boost mobile. I read the reviews on it here and on Boost Mobile Website. I was going to buy this phone for my mother originally but I ended up buying it for myself. I explain the excitement and joy this phone is doing for me. It's inexpensive and excellent thus far. You will not be disappointed if you invest in this purchase. I received this phone Friday, May 18th. The transition with SmartSwitch was so easy, simple and stress free. Just wonderful! Thank you Amazon for this awesome and outstanding deal!! I will be purchasing this phone again for my mother within the next few weeks\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f",

I followed all prompts on the box to activate the phone and none of them worked I even paid the plan for the month because that \"supposedly\" would activate the phone (which didn't) instead it gave me a # with the last 4 digits missing from it so I don't even know the # to the phone. I called Verizon's customer service and couldn't get through to no one. The automated system kept asking for different #'s on the box which I couldn't give because labels had been placed over all of the information on the box. When I finally got through the representatives kept giving me #'s for the prepaid department that didn't work so finally I decided to go to the corporate Verizon store to find out apparently the sim card that comes with the phone wasn't the right one so the store had to call customer care to get another one sent out (still waiting...) phone overall isn't bad but the Camera quality isn't good. Other than the activation process and poor camera quality it's not TOO bad.",

I guess the only thing Samsung really invests in is their flagships, but at $1200 a pop, I won't be standing in line...ever.

            "body": "I'm not on the phone a ton, but this phone has been fantastic for the price. I see people paying hundreds of dollars, up to over a thousand now, on a phone. That is ridiculous. If Virgin Mobile has good service in your area, this phone will suit all your smartphone needs as long as you're not on it 24/7. Or even then who knows - it has great battery life and a feature where you can extend the battery life by several days. Decent enough space to put music on it or store files. Reliable operating system; handles all apps with no problem as it is a standard android. Great phone, period. 10/10",

With the included charging block it can fully charge in 8 hours and last all day. I was gonna get another one for my free account if l liked this one but this phone is so usable that I don't need a backup or supplement. It does support app to SD but you have to look for it and the 7 gigs of available internal memory is impressive. I have 150 apps and have room for more. So if you like to use media player apps and third party SMS and contact apps with alot of themes go for it. It doesn't have a notification LED but the status bar has the potential to use multi color notifications. I miss the settings Widgets that were in the marshmallow android. This phone has the android 7.0 operating system (nougat). I'm hoping it will last a while because it works so well. It is possible to move some apps to the SD card. I have 209 apps and only using 72% of internal storage. 35 apps are themes and 77 moved to SD card.",

The only other item I can't change is the bloatware that Virgin Mobile loads on the phone. This maybe causing part of the lag. Tonight I have had it, so I am writing this review.

Updates for Android, Daily updates for Google Services, and other Google apps. Response has deteriorated to the point of locking me out of the sign in screen after 3 seconds, even when I put the right screen pattern. It's slow, even when no apps are apparently running, I've optimized the memory several times to squeeze out some use out of it. Thinking about either resetting the phone back to factory settings, or else get a flip phone, because those don't give you as much problem as this.",

It was the worst customer support experience of my life. Word to the wise - if you purchase this phone and there is any issue with it upon trying to activate it: return the phone immediately. Do *not* call Boost Mobile support as they are terrible.",

The filter for the camera is amazing, which is important for all us selfie lovers. It takes amazing pictures! All around just a great phone to have at a great price!",

It comes with a sim card, its a pre-paid phone but for $40 plus tax you can have it started up as a pre-paid and then immediately moved over to your regular cell account on your existing line and number. It takes really nice picture - inside, outside, daytime and nighttime as far as we can tell from two days experimenting. Verizon won't let you immediately put on your existing line, you must follow the above mentioned procedure. I went from a flip to this, my first smartphone. If you don't want to pay mega bucks and want to get in the door, this is the way to go, seriously its a great phone.",

This phone does well in everything but in 2017 this is not a $200 or even a $150. I think this would be a good buy at maybe $120.

I have moved everything else that I can from the internal to the SD card.

However, the most frustrating aspect of this phone is that no matter what I do, it freezes up ALL the time. Not sure if it is a low memory issue - in which I installed a SD card that didn't help. Or, I thought it might be a problem with apps. I didn't have a lot installed, but I did like to play a couple little games and stream some music once in a while, so eliminated almost all my apps, some of which would freeze up anyway. Still didn't help much. Like I said very frustrating and extremely annoying. I'd be listening to Spotify and a call would come in causing the phone to freeze, I'd look something up on the internet, then try to access the Google Maps feature, the phone would freeze, I would try to take a picture (picture quality is just OK BTW) and get a message there is not enough memory even though I have a SD card installed, and the phone would freeze. Actually I discovered that my phone will behave itself if I restart immediately after using memory intensive apps like Facebook, mobile banking, or YouTube. But heck, even the restart feature has frozen up on me. I believe Samsung does make quality products, but this phone is not one of them.",

            "body": "After shattering my iPhone SE 16GB, this is what I chose as a replacement. Missing luxuries from my previous phone: NFC, I really used NFC whenever I would forget my wallet, and often found myself seeking out stores who used this pay method. This phone does not have that. A fingerprint scanner is also missing. The DPI is almost 100 DPI less than the iPhone SE, however, watching movies on this Perx is still delightful, especially with the larger, wide screen. While it is not a crispy over saturated AMOLED screen, it is still HD, and at times I find mysel grabbing this phone, with its powerful battery, over my Samsung S2 8\" powerhouse & whimpy battery. My poor little iPhone SE only had 16gb of space. This Perx only has 16gb, and only ten of those are available. Yet, becasue of the SD Card slot, I can expand up to 128GB, perhpas more. A cavet here is that the, forced on you - Amazon apps are bonded to the internal memory which is quite annoying because I would like to put them on the external memory and relinquish space. This is not a problem on my Samsung Tablet, but it is on this phone. The CPU on this thing is obviously powerful. However, it could use more RAM. I find that i use multiple apps, for texting, photo editing, social media and a nice launcher (NOVA). I am not sure if this is the cause for the sudden and unpredictable mollases speed. Seriously I go from spritely and quick to mired down and stuck. I am tempted to go back to factory settings and slowly download my essential apps, until I start experiencing that lag. I have a feelingly I'll find a sweet spot and compromise. This same scenario occured with my Amazon Tablet which had a paltry 1.5 gb of running memory. I had to cut it down until it ran smoothly . For the money this is an exceptional mid range phone. This will run games well, but you don't want to run a horde of apps in the back ground. With Android, it's about balance. So this is my first time has with Android after about two years. Android is far more manipulatable. The iPhone always have a silky performance. Am i unhappy with this phone? Not in the least. It was a great buy.",

            "body": "I have owned two LG \"budget\" smartphones through Verizon, the second of which was bought during H Harvey when the first LG ceased working in the high humidity. Last week I lost the LG smartphone, and the only \"budget\" phone available was the Galaxy J7. It has been hard to use. For one thing, malware with ads almost immediately downloaded with eithr a Verizon or a Google Play app; Google Play Services are partnered with the phone. I called Samsung, which remotely took control of the phone but was not able to delete the malware. Second, and more importantly, the phone freezes A LOT. Despite the fact that the Samsung agent set all of the APPS and controls to optimum performance, the phone does permit many system overrides. Compared to the LG phones that I owned, this phone, while beautiful to look at, is not operating well. It is \"buggy\" and, consequently, time-consuming to operate easily. EDIT: I have been able to improve the performance of the cell phone by working to uninstall or disable the many, many apps that are pre-installed on the phone. Many are system apps but seem to serve no purpose. I also discovered that the Messages app is not quite the same as the Messages+ app and that some of the problems that I thought were \"freezing problems\" were user-error problems associated with the fact that the two apps delete messages differently. So I have upgraded my rating from ONE star to THREE stars because I have learned how to speed-up the response time of the phone. The popup ads are still a problem. As noted before, a Samsung agent took-over the phone remotely but could not remove the popup ads. The suggestions made by the Verizon agent did not remove the ads. I have been using FORCE STOP with the Game Launcher and Game Tools apps and hope this will correct the problem. Have cleared cache of the browsers and apps numerous times already.",

            "body": "Actual buyer and user, non paid, I really like the large screen, very long lasting battery and 16G memory. It runs Android 7 after 6 mos now I am satisfied for the $159 phone and so far so good. I will say the buttons are hard to push, it lags sometimes and takes time the flip from up to sideways but the battery lasts 2 days and that is great! Sometimes when charging though it is slow or takes too long, I am not sure why but the plug is hard to get in and that may be a problem later on. Like the screen size 5.5, easy to find cases, just the right large size to still fit in a shirt pocket. I am a verizon prepay customer and up graded from a 4.3\" LG and like this better than any phone I have used. The most expensive phone I have bought but worth it. I am sure I am missing something from the $800 phones but I have cash in my pocket and for talk and text it is great.",

All apps are slow if you just have snapchat still open -slower cpu, making large apps load slowly -battery life isn't bad at all, but not as good as my last phone (Galaxy J3-6) -Wifi isn't very good all around.

So incredibly slow, apps constantly freezing, calls where I couldn't see the ID, friends telling me they never got my texts, constant need of restarting. Contacted Samsung who had me do a full factory reset to no avail. Sent in to Samsung, got back reset again, reinstalled everything, straight back to it again after about 2 weeks. Called Samsung again, who want me to do ANOTHER factory reset and all these tests before sending in for another repair. After seeing all the bad reviews on here, clearly the issue is not my phone, it's THE phone. I give up. Awful.",

How about 6 days on one charge on average? Or an incredibly brilliant screen? Or a nice jump in screen size, but not preposterously huge. The processors fast, the sound quality is great, the connectivity is tight and it is extremely user friendly. I'm sticking with this beauty till another visit from the BLACK SCREEN OF DOOM. If it's as durable as my dear old s5, that'll be about 4years from now.",

I had previously been using a Motorola G 3rd Gen, with a paltry 1gb of ram and a very sad CPU. I had constant hang ups, freezes, app crashes, and really annoying screen zooming when I'd try to scroll. After a lot of reading I settled on the J7 Perx. So far it has been a wonderful device, smooth and responsive, and with a great deal of customization for the UI and keyboard. I really enjoy the resizable keyboard and how responsive it is. No lagging behind like my old phone when typing, and that's a huge plus. Audio quality is solid, and the phone is able to multitask quite well. I haven't noticed any hanging applications or stutters, but I have only been using this device for a week or so now, so more remains to be seen. For what the device costs it has already proven its worth to me, considering all the niggling issues I had with my older device are completely absent here. It is a solid phone, and definitely radiates quality. I would definitely recommend it at this price range.",

            "body": "So, I may have just gotten a defective phone, but my review is based on the one I have in my hand writing this right now. As I write this, my phone ia plugged into power and yet, is still managing to use up battery power. This is a daily problem with this phone for me. It gets too hot every day, stops charging every day, and leaves me wanting more out of my purchase... every day. There's also the fact that this phone doesn't do voice and data at the same time. Not super inconvenient most of the time, but the times it's inconvenient, it's incredibly so. Then there's the memory issue, not being able to move all your apps to the SD card and the temporarily locking up when you switch apps. There's also the fact that when you move an app to the SD card it removes the availability of the widget... I could really go on for hours with complaints as I no longer have any good points to bring up about this phone. I feel like these are all of the QC rejects put on sale for us Amazon \"dupes\" to purchase. After reading more online I discovered many people having the same problems. It's my fault really for not researching more thoroughly before buying, but as it was an emergency purchase due to a previously destroyed phone I was a little rushed on my decision making. Would I ever buy this phone again..? Based on this experience I'll never buy this particular model again. I also am unlikely to buy a Samsung phone period after this, as it was my first Samsung experience. I would say the disapointment stings like a snake bite. For a device that we as humans now depend on to help run our lives, more care should be taken to put out a product worthy of that expectation. This device has most definitely not met the most basic of those expectations, let alone going beyond in any way. I recommend passing and buying another phone if you're considering this one. I'm currently on here looking for a replacement phone already, after owning it for less than 6 months.",

            "body": "This is a review of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Perx for the Boost Mobile prepaid network. Note this phone is locked to Boost Mobile, there are other versions of the same phone which will be locked to other providers. Do NOT purchase this phone other than for the Boost Mobile network. My Galaxy J7 Perx is replacing a Samsung Galaxy 5. It has a larger screen, and a longer run time. There is a lot of bloat / spy ware included with the phone (Facebook as an example can't be uninstalled). Google spying just comes with Android, it's built in. There is a fair bit of other junk Boost Mobile included (Instagram and other stuff) which can't be removed, some of it (but not all of it) can be disabled. Many complain the phone is slow. If your phone is slow the cause may be a defective phone OR bloatware. Facebook for example must scan all your gmail messages and phone home, this can take both time and resources. Other products will behave similarly, during the initial \"scan\" of your device by the bundled applications the phone may be a bit sluggish. After a while, either by stopping bloat, or letting it run through your stuff, the phone should be relatively snappy. The phone is fast for me, faster than a Galaxy 5 or 6, not as good of course as a Galaxy 8. While it has 8 cores, and can issue 2 instructions (sometimes) per cycle on a 2.3 GHz clock the 8 instruction pipeline doesn't function out of sequence. Thus each instruction must be processed in order. The GPU is fairly powerful, this phone has a 5.5\" screen and may not quite be a phablet phone. It offers 720 x 1200 resolution (not 1080 x 1920). While this is considered HD, it is the lower HD standard, most often used by broadcasters. If you get close to the screen, some pixelation is visible. It has a long run time. On Boost mobile this phone had 5 bars of 4G LTE while my older Galaxy 5 using the same Sprint network via Freedompop had only 2 bars. Download speed for this phone is almost 3 times as fast as the speed for my Galaxy 5 after trying several different locations. It may be due to improved phone technology, or due to Boost Mobile getting better data access than Freedompop, but it is nice to have decent speed. I would have preferred a 7 or 8 inch phone, literally a tablet phone, but my budget didn't permit it. My Boost Mobile plan does have tethering (hotspot) and speeds were about half on the hotspot what they were directly to the phone. So hotspot isn't as fast as a direct 4G connection. My speed on this phone averages about 30 Mbs download and a bit under 9Mbs upload. The play store works well. No fingerprint scanner, for security use a PIN. :( Considering the world we live in, where Facebook, Google and whatever else mines our personal information and adversely affects device performance, this is a decent reasonably low cost phone. The Galaxy J7 Perx goes on sale sometimes for as low as $90, in my case the plan I wanted from Boost Mobile was expiring soon and this caused me to pay $129 per phone, which is still not that bad. The front camera is 8 megapixels and works better in low light than other cameras I've used, a slightly lower resolution camera with better low light capability and less blur is an advantage to a few extra megapixels in my opinion. Play store, Google calendar and what not work well. Samsung by default sticks its browser in the quick launch tab. You will notice a cluster of Google, Samsung and Boost Mobile apps many of which provide similar or identical function. If you want Chrome, just move the Samsung browser out and Chrome in. Chrome is better.",

I can just be on apps for hours without having to charge. It dies pretty quickly if I'm in public with data running. It's a great size. The speakers are awesome. The camera quality is very good. This phone has absolutely no storage though.",

            "body": "My thoughts afters a couple of months. First off, it is very close in look and feel to flagship smart phone. Secondly, it functions perfectly well and has most of the top end qualities. It's fast enough and the screen is quite nice(more than acceptable). The battery is great and buttons are good. But of course you will notice it doesn't have the same level of storage or camera quality you get at the near $1000 price ranges. Overall it perfect for trying to save money on your new phone without having to sacrifice modern day accessibility. Would recommend to anyone who doesn't specifically need the best of the best available.",

My only complaint - other than relearning the buttons because of course it is the opposite of my old phone - is that speaker is very wimpy.

It's the best phone I've had so far (I never get the latest and greatest but I have had Samsung before). What I love about it is the amount of built in storage space for lots of apps, the large screen, the great quality pictures....it was very easy to set up. I opened the phone and logged into my virgin mobile account and then it transferred phones for me and even remembered my apps! I like that it's super easy to uninstall apps. On my own phone I had to go into storage and click a few buttons to delete something. In this one, I can swipe the app to the trash can! Charge seems to last for a good while. Previous phone had to be charged twice daily. This one seems to be once daily, at least so far. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that even though this phone is better than my last and more expensive, the internet is slower! Takes longer for things to load. I know I can use Wi-Fi at home but it takes longer while I'm out and while I'm at work than it did on my cheaper phone.",

            "body": "Update to my review: As of today, 11/30/17, this phone under the Virgin Mobile brand is marked down to $129.99. Virgin Mobile's website, which had it for $199.99, is no longer carrying *any* Androids. They've transitioned over to iPhones only. The TracFone is the star of the current pricing, well under $100. Verizon still wants the most money for this model, on Amazon: $159.99 When I bought this phone, it was $137.99 on Amazon. It then jumped up to $149.99. At $129.99, it is taking all of the restraint to not buy several of these to put in a closet and have them on hand for when this one eventually goes to the great cellphone landfill in the sky. Oh,and Sprint still wants $270 for it... ********************************** Let's start this off with I am not a tech person. I have no desire to have the biggest, best, trendiest, latest and greatest in smartphones, and this is probably the nicest phone I've ever owned. I like it. A lot. The built-in bloatware isn't all terrible. Some of it is useful, like the Samsung Health app that can track and count your steps. The camera is good. It didn't take me long to set it up, and it runs Nougat. Remember i said I don't need the latest things? I don't, but it's nice to have. Nougat isn't what sold me on this phone. What did sell me were the reviews, and the fact that the Moto G 3rd Gen i had was about to be hurled through a window. I bought a 32gb card for the Moto, and it was useless because 3rd Gen didn't let you move apps. It was all internal storage and the phone was becoming a doorstop quickly. That 32gb card is getting use in this phone. The one feature I really like is in Settings/Device maintenance, which lets you see what's going on with memory, battery life and storage and lets you correct the issues on the spot. The battery life is pretty impressive. Nothing will ever come close to our \"dumbphone\" battery charges, but this not only has a long life, but also charges rapidly when you plug it in. I've found 2 cases on Amazon that work well with this phone: both have like a built in wallet, and a detachable strap that makes it a wristlet. Depending on the vendor, you won't have to pay more than $7.99. 1 case is rose gold, the other black. I have no idea why the phone has gone up $12 in price since i purchased it. (As of this writing, it's $149.99. I paid $137.99. However, it's $199.99 on Virgin Mobile's site. I've never dropped over a hundred bucks on any cellphone prior to this. I've limited my purchases of Virgin Mobile phones to Black Friday sales at brick and mortar Targets and Kmarts from 2009-2015. They'd have 50% off whatever and so I bought whatever...always in multiples, and the price range with the Black Friday pricing averaged $20. Buying 2 or 3, I'd have a backup phone on hand, and never bother paying $5/mo for insurance. Those paid for themselves. The one truly awful phone was the Samsung Galaxy Ring for Virgin Mobile, which had a Black Friday price tag of $50. That phone was literally the worst. I had no idea why Samsung would allow their name on it. This phone far exceeds any expectations i had, and i may buy another as a backup, since toward the end of 2018, Virgin won't be as Android-friendly. They're going to exclusively sell iPhones only, and I'm not *that* customer. If you're a Virgin customer, you know what geographical locations near you are strongest and weakest. I don't have enough weak areas that would make me switch to another carrier, so I'm content to stay with the Samsung Galaxy J7 Perx for the foreseeable future.",

            "body": "This is, by far, the worst smart phone I've owned (almost ten, second Samsung). Its blutooth pairing is completely unreliable and --worst of all-- its interface is incredibly slow and unresponsive. I touch the screen and nothing happens: is it because the app is bogged down or did the phone not register the touch? WAIT AND SEE! I know it's the phone because I have the exact same experience with the two bottom touch buttons and with the only physical press-down button. My normal experience is a 2-5 second delay responding to a major action like launching, closing, or switching between an app. Apps that worked just fine on my last two phones now crash or freeze. Once in a while the phone notices the app is not responding but, more often I'm the one that has to notice and take action, which segues nicely into my next complaint. I have to reboot this phone constantly. Phone stops responding in an app and won't close/switch apps? REBOOT. Phone experiences network blip? REBOOT. Phone can't talk to an already-paired blutooth device? REBOOT. Phone can't detect a new blutooth device? REBOOT. Phone is on? REBOOT. It's like a Windows computer from before, uh, well, probably still. The pre-loaded ROM has annoying problems but someone who likes the phone could fix that with minimal effort so I'm not getting into them beyond noting they exist. It gets two stars because it turns on and performs basic functions, however poorly. I'm considering it a bad mistake and am looking into replacing it and just eating the purchase price. Yes, it's that bad. I like to donate old phones to Cell Phones for Soldiers, but donating this would seem like a bad prank. I will probably go Office Space on it when I pick a replacement. PC LOAD LETTER THIS, SAMSUNG. I should note, for context, my favorite smart phone was a Samsung. No other phone has matched it. I also have both this piece of garbage and an iPhone 7plus, which I don't like but works so well it makes this phone's faults that much more apparent.",

            "body": "Upgraded from a HTC desire 816. It was a tough choice to switch because i wasn't sure if it was worth the leap. Well 16gb internal memory is not so great. Would of prefer 32gb since the year is 2017 and anything less seem cheap! The screen reminds me a lot of htc desire 816 so if you are worried? Don't be you'll be right at home. I bought a 200gb micro sd and wallet case. The octa core and updated android 7 os is the reason i upgraded. So after buying the phone and accessories is the phone worth it? Yes! The only issue I have is the low 16gb internal memory. The camera is not better than the old HTC desire 816 and the sound lost to the HTC desire 816 I was listening to music and could hear a big difference!! So if the HTC desire had 16gb internal storage. I wouldn't of upgraded. I'm still using the HTC desire 816 as a tablet for music, watching movies, taking pictures, videos on YouTube and Facebook. So it still has use after. I can already see myself upgrading the j7 perx to something more later on due to lack of features and a horrible camera. This perx back camera takes pictures like it is a front facing cam. It's not good. Midrange phone with midrange parts. HTC 816 has 13 megapixels. Perx has less! I hate to compare it to htc desire 816 but even that is considered mid range phone but it is awesome! Just the low internal memory and old android os ruin it's life span. So the only upgrade J7 Perx have to offer is 16gb internal memory which only 10gb is usable, octa core cpu and android 7 os. That is basically it. Not much of a leap. Just staying afloat until a bigger jump comes along.",

            "body": "I previously had a Samsung galaxy j7 2015 and I loved it! It was very colorful. This phone on the other hand is kinda plain. The color of the contacts are white, the keyboard is white, I do like this phone. I love that it's black. I switched phones because I had the 2015 version and I was impatiently waiting for the 7.0 Nougat software. Maybe this phone will update and it will get a splash of color. The volume is really good! The main screen with the apps looks nice but over all the Samsung galaxy j7 2015 was my favorite. But don't get me wrong, it's a good phone. I just received it today and I'm activating my phone tomorrow. I love Virgin Mobile. I switched from Boost mobile. I hope this helped. :)",

            "body": "Got this in lieu of a contract phone, and honestly, it's an okay phone but I wouldn't use it to try to do anything else really. Even something as simple today as running Facebook, the phone will constantly lag, some websites can take up to a minute to fully load, which sounds in title as hell but in modern times most web pages can load up in under 10 seconds. If you're getting this phone to just text talk and maybe send emails, it might be okay. If you're getting this phone in the hopes that you'll be able to play games, browse Facebook, watch videos, I would honestly opt-in for a higher grade phone. Edit: just today, after writing this review, I had a scenario where it took the keyboard that should automatically pop up once you hit a text field, take 15 seconds to pop up itself. On top of that text was about 5 Seconds delayed. I have had to lower my review of this phone to one star, I would strongly suggest not purchasing this phone. For the price that you have to pay in the end which is about $170, I would invest elsewhere.",

I tap something to open it and the screen freezes for about 30 seconds before it opens, can't shut the screen of, go to home screen or anything. I have to remove the battery like 3 times a day due to this. I've only had it for 3 months now and will be getting a new phone as soon as I have the money. Hate this thing! It's just awful.

            "body": "I have been using Samsung phones for years. My hubby bought the J7 and loves it. I decided to upgrade my S5 (the only phone i have ever paid full price for-$500). I wanted to purchase the J7 but by the time i was ready to purchase they had the J7 Perx. I thought to myself 'self, what could be that different?' Since i have had this phone it has been slow, the screens go white or black when online or using an app. I thought maybe it was because of service, but my hubby and i both have Boost and he doesn't have the same problems. Trying to take pictures takes forever. I will tap the camera to take the pic and nothing happens. Trying to have others take pics when we are out and about is frustrating because the camera doesn't work quickly. You have to tap on the button multiple times for it to take. This is by far the worst Samsung phone i have ever had and don't recommend it at all. I learned that the J7 has been discontinued. Now i have to decide to stick with Samsung or try out iPhone. Lately when i get calls the phone will ring but i can't see who is calling me so i can't answer. Sometimes when i try to use apps (especially Amazon) the screen will be white and i have to restart the phone. Super frustrated with this horrible phone. Way to go Samsung quality control.",

            "body": "Terrible phone. One of the reviews here said owning this phone was like dating a hot girl with bad but it's even worse. First off the battery life is terrible. Usually won't make it through a whole day unless the phone is not used. Despite having the 8 core processor, it is slow. Everything is slow to respond. The 16gb internal memory also does not provide much space to load apps. I ran into space problems frequently. I finally had no choice to switch when, after only 6 months the screen started flickering worse and worse. Now I'm using a Moto E Plus on AT&T and I'm so glad I had to switch. After about 8 years I've decided Virgin mobile is no good either. Coverage isn't very good and not the best deals. I'm paying $30 per month now for 1gb of data, unlimited talk and text compared to virgins $35 per month 1.5gb data unlimited talk text. With virgin, texts sometimes don't get delivered for 10 minutes. Maybe that's on purpose to help parents keep the kids virgins? The Moto E Plus also has a 5000ma battery compared to the 3000ma battery in the J7. And with AT&T you can use data while on a call.",

            "body": "I bought this for my daughter for Xmas. I read A LOT of Q&A's to make sure that whatever I chose, it was in as best condition that I could find and unlocked so that she would be able to connect to her service. Everything I went through on this phone was exactly what I was looking for; however, she has not been able to connect it to her service because it keeps saying it is locked by verizon. She was told by verizon and apple that the phone is unlocked but when she puts in her sim card, it doesn't work. Apple tried to work with her to unlock it but was still unable to unlock. Now it seems we have to either look for a phone kit to hopefully fix the issue or return it so she can get something else. This is infuriating when we spent over $300 and now either possibly more or she has to go without a phone with a one year old at home so we can return it. I haven't been able to find how to contact them. Hopefully someone sees this and helps me fix it or I'm going to air mail it back to their office and not care where it lands.",

It's wonderful seeing that, what used to fill my old phone's 32 GB, now occupies only a minuscule portion of the available storage. It only has two negatives: - The sleep button is on the side, so, when I turn it off, I also change the ringer volume.. - Since it's so smooth, I worry about losing grip and dropping it when I pull it from my pocket.",

It just doesn't work for the network that I need it to work on, at this point I just hope they accept my return and I can get my money back so I can give someone a phone that will actually work. Also it's the duos version so it may or may not say that on the back, basically you can put two sim cards in it. Honestly I think this would work better for someone who isn't in the U.S.",

It'll have the languages on it, etc. such that it is usable however, there could be things on your calendar that can NOT be removed, other aspects of the phone could change depending on the firmware installed. The alerts(test, amber, etc.) cannot be turned off with this foreign firmware. Even if they say they're turned off, they will come through whenever they're sent, think about it.This is my issue with the phone for the software, I come from having a note 3 and a note 5, I am basically spoiled by the notes, the screen is better in that I don't have to worry about a beveled screen. That aspect of the screen DOES alter how what you're looking at appears there. I do a lot of reading, its annoying to have the screen like that.",

I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back.",

            "title_review": "Beautiful phone with great functionalities.",
            "body": "Beautiful phone with great functionalities and it is an incredible advancement from my old Samsung Galaxy Avant which is a great working phone, but it's been getting buggy in the last six months. I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it. My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out. The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same. After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly. I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it. The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia. I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone. There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc. I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc. This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased. I will update my post in a few weeks to a month.",

Also, on the back of the phone it is telling \"DUOS\", meaning it is Dual SIMCard, which non of the Unite state Samsung Galaxy S8 is DUOS. I don't recommend this phone.

            "title_review": "Lots of PROs & minor CONs",
            "body": "A very solid 4.5 Stars This is just my review of the S8 Plus. I got mine through AT&T as my upgrade. I was trying to wait for the Note 8 but my Note 4 bricked when the power died during an update so I had to replace it with something fast. The S8 Plus is a really nice-looking phone and the camera is awesome. It's probably the best feature so far (I've had mine for about 3 weeks). I don't like that I can't replace the battery if I ever wanted to. The Bixby feature is somewhat useful but there is a bit of a learning curve to using it. I haven't been using it much but that's because I'm busy getting used to the rest of the phone. One thing that I really *don't* like about the phone is that it is slippery as an eel. I almost dropped it the first time I held it because it's so slick. The phone is very thing (a good thing, I guess), but I keep it in a protective case. One reason I immediately got a case for it was just to be able to hold and handle it better. Whenever it's out of the case, I'm scared to death do use it because I know I'll drop it. If this phone has the built-in stylus like the Note series, I would like it better than the Note 3 and 4 which I've had. The display is crystal crisp and beautiful. I got mine in the Arctic Silver and wish that I could actually see it, but I have to keep that casing on it! I know that some people wanted the smoother outer design, but I'd much rather that it were pebbled - or at least along the edges. I bet half the time the phone gets damaged will not be from carelessness but from the phone just sliding out of people's hands. So, to sum up, the PROs: - Phone is gorgeously styled and the color choices are nice. I really like the Arctic Silver which is stylish and still professional/adult looking. - Camera is *amazing*. Photos turn out awesome and the easy-flip to selfie feature is nice. - Volume control is better. You can more easily control volume for all settings (Media, Headset, Notifications, etc) than before. - Fingerprint placing isn't as bad as I expected and is a lot more responsive than on past Galaxy phones. - There are temperature sensors so I can use the apps that I couldn't with the Note 4. - Wireless Qcoil charging is possible. (With the Note 4 I had to buy a Qi receiver to place inside the phone to work with a charger.) - Sound quality - for calls and media - is especially good. This was a surprise to me. CONS: - While the body design is beautiful, the phone is slippery and very easily dropped. It's a MUST to have a case on it to make it easier to hold. - Bixby needs to be a bit more user-friendly since it's so new to most of us. - The charging ports have changed so all the cords I had for past Galaxy phones are now worthless. Also, the new USB C type chargers don't work with my Samsung tablet. It's a little like changing the game to make customers shell out more money for accessories. - There is no built-in stylus. This is such a wonderful feature - and probably the only real standout feature - on the Notes, I'm surprised Samsung hasn't integrated it into their other models. OVERALL: If I could change 2 things, it would be the slippery-ness and that there is no built-in stylus. As a firm Note 4 fanatic, I am not that unhappy to have this phone instead.",

Before this phone, I had the s5 that couldn't even hold up 5 hours total. This phone gets me through the day and plus some. I was also able to transfer everything from my s5 to this phone with just a few taps of a button during the startup. My carrier is cricket. Fyi, if you are transferring SIM cards from your old phone to your new phone, make sure that the SIM card is a nano one. I had the average sized one in my s5 and needed to go to my provider to exchange SIMs Update: after 3 months of having the phone, I started to get a \"no network connection\" message and the phone stopped recognizing my Sim card. I bought a new Sim to see if that helped and it didn't. I even did a network reset and a hard reset on the phone to no avail. The phone is completely useless unless I'm connected to wifi. I can no longer receive texts or calls. I have read that some of the phones have this same problem. Maybe I'm just one of the unlucky ones. It was great while it lasted, but I can't help to feel cheated out of my money. I just pre-ordered the s9+ from the Samsung website, so hopefully that will be the last time that I would have to purchase a phone.",

Will update the review if this is resolved without me needing to pay for shipping/call the seller a third time. Gave two stars because the phone itself is solid. I recommend this if you are looking for a Verizon locked phone. Note that the S6 uses a nano sim card. There are resources out there to modify your existing sim to that form factor if you don't already have one.",

I had to send it back, not to mention I could tell the charger port hole was a big chewed up. I ordered this again foolishly. while the phone works, it is FILLED with ads. They come up often, sometimes you cant figure out how to get out of the ad and this eats up the battery, it barely lasts a full day.",

The replacement I received had small pieces of the top of the screen chipped off, and a broken fingerprint scanner, but the cameras work. \ud83d\ude44 I tried to get a 2nd replacement but Amazon wouldn't let me due to \"limitations\" or whatever. This phone was a gift so I can't return it without replacing it. Had I known about the limitations for replacement, I wouldn't have kept it. The Amazon Renewed description claims that the item should be free of visible imperfections when held 12 inches away, but a chipped glass screen is easy to spot. This company clearly doesn't refurbish anything, they just do a factory reset and toss it in the box. I have no idea how they received Amazon's approval.",

No issue with activating with Verizon; in fact I switched the SIM from my Windows phone to this one online in 5-10 minutes. Process was swift and easy. The phone is functioning well, but battery doesn't last long, however I can probably resolve by clearing out some background processes. Previous owner took pretty good care of the device, so physically looks like a brand new phone. The only con so far is the power/lock button is compressed, so it doesn't click or move much when pressed, but it works with a harder press. Overall (so far) I'm happy with my purchase.",

The downside was I thought the packaging for such a high priced item was scarce and it was rolling around a bit when it arrive. Since it was branded with Verizon I felt comfortable walking in my Verizon Store and asking for the transfer of my old phone to the new one. My Verizon store was awesome and gave me the card I needed to get started. Specific to the Galaxy S6 I wish that when the phone is charging the screen would go dark, but I just touch the button on the side and it does it.",

Soon I'll want a newer model with a better camera, but this one is still going strong. Still using Straight Talk Wireless with no issues. Great purchase. August 2016 - Mine arrived in really good condition, like new, no scratches, very minor wear. I bought a SIM card for Straight Talk Wireless at the store, followed the instructions, and now I'm paying a lot less per month than I was under contract. So far, so good. Will update if anything unexpected happens during use.",

On a whim, I decided to try other chargers. I discovered that my Kindle charger worked. Once charging was resolved, I was able to use the phone. One major hassle was that the phone set up was defaulted to Spanish. Once I figured out how to change it to English (following Spanish directions), all was good. It was unlocked and works great with a Straight Talk sim. I've had it for almost 9 months now. It has occasional glitches with the screen freezing or suddenly shutting off, but they are rare and this is a great phone overall. The size is perfect and the camera quality is excellent.",

            "title_review": "Sony Returns to Form",
            "body": "With the XZ1, Sony's Xperia line returns to form. After wandering in the cel phone wilderness for the last year or so, the electronics giant pulled their collective heads out of their collective hindquarters and have delivered a very good (if not quite great) flagship mobile device. The past 12-16 months gave us the X, the X Compact, the X Performance, the XZ, the XZS, the XA1, and a gaggle of other mid-tier offerings from Sony. Of them, only the XZS and the XZ Premium could come close to laying claim to flagship status, with the latter coming with one of the finest 4K displays in the business. Unfortunately XZS didn't come with a battery big enough to power the nice phone specs, and the XZ Premium was an exceptionally large phone, at an exceptionally large price. The XZ1 sees the company step up it's game. As of this writing, it's one of the few devices shipping with Android 8 / Oreo out of the box, running the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, with a beautiful 1080 display and a slightly-refined physical design and sturdy-feeling build-quality. And for nearly $700, it certainly should have a premium feel to it. Even the best phones are balancing acts of compromise, so while there's certainly something here for everyone, it's also unlikely to appeal to absolutely everyone. Most people either love or hate Sony's take on industrial design. Some bemoan the size of the top and bottom bezels. In a world where the S8 strives to give customers nothing-but-screen, Sony certainly isn't following the fashion train. But they sure as heck are following the functional-device-train. Having owned an S8, I certainly see the appeal. It's a beautiful looking device. But at the end of the day, I found the lack of bezels to be a problem in day to day use. With no edge on which to rest fingertips, I was constantly accidentally activating various apps, or accidentally hitting the wrong onscreen area within a given app. Nice to look at...but darn if it's not a pain to actually use. So, here's a subjective run down of Pros and Cons: PRO - Great screen. In addition to it's Triluminous setting, Sony has added a new video color-saturating setting. Honestly, it looks like they're taking a stab at the popping colors and deep blacks on OLED devices like the S8. And they've done a good job...this is one of the sharpest, most color popping screens out there at the moment. - Great processor. The new Snapdragon is great. Everything runs smoothly. - Headphone jack / Audio processing. Yay for hanging on to this bit of tech, the old headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones are well and good, but they eat up a battery, and they can't deliver the same quality of audio as a wired set. If how your music sounds on your device is important to you, wired is still the way to go. For now at least. And Sony's DESS audio processing sounds pretty great to my ears. Pick up a third party audio player like Neutron if you'd like even more control of the sound. CON - Physical design. This really doesn't belong in the \"con\" column, but the fact is either you like what Sony is doing here, or you don't. - Price. Sony offers a handful of budget models, but their flagship line has never been anything but pricey. Especially in America where the brand isn't known for it's mobile devices, the average android user might be hard pressed to pay $699 to a company they normally associate with televisions. In Europe and Asia, though, Sony remains a popular contender with Samsung and Apple for high end devices. - Battery. This also might not be a negative, as the new Snapdragon and Oreo are alleged to be more efficient with their power use. Running some benchmarks seem to bear this out, as while it leads in most areas, there are some processes they've scaled back. So far, I don't see any penalty in processing power, but I've also not had it long enough to take a firm stance on battery life. But anecdotally, it does seem to be an improvement over the XZS and XZ Performance.",

            "body": "They have this advertised as a US Warranty but I am currently going back and forth with Sony because the phone stopped charging after 2 months. I sent it to Sony and they took almost 2 months to get the phone back to me unrepaired. I called them and they had to escalate my complaint of them not fixing the phone and not letting me know why. After several emails they have told me that 1. the phone was originally sold to Panama and they do not have the tools to fix it in the US. 2. I requested they replace the phone and Sony has stated that since it was sold to Panama Sony in the US is not able to replace the phone as warranties are different in each country. SO BEWARE OF THIS! I purchased the extended warranty through Amazon so I will be going to them and see if they are able to help me and once I get that figured out I will update my review. But currently I am not happy with Sony or the people selling this phone stating it has a US Warranty when it does not (according to Sony).",

            "body": "I am an employee of Sony and have used the Xperia phones since the old ZL from 2013. Of course these were company phones, but we had a choice of using these phones which were free or paying for Samsung or iPhones. Of course I chose the Xperia. Since Sony ditched carrier based phones, the bloat-ware on these is almost non-existent. You get the Android OS with a minimal Sony overlay. But that is it...no AT&T apps, No T-mobile carp, and certainly no Verizon bloat or two year later updates. And I think that is the main reason why Sony ditched the carrier based phone- Updates. Anyway, the XZ1 is fast, thin and good looking. It does what I want, has lots of room for storage of pics and video that can be shot in normal mode or with their awesome slo-mo video. The only draw back I can find is that while it is dual sim, meaning you can have two sim cards with two different numbers. For example you can have a US based AT&T sim card then travel to Japan and use a Japanese based sim card at the same time and switch between the two. But the problem is, that second sim card is used at the expense of the SD Card, which will need to be removed. Other than that, the screen is huge and crystal clear, the buttons are where they should be, and it does exactly what it's supposed to. I highly recommend a case with a tactile feel as this phone is smooth and slippery..",

            "body": "I bought the international unlocked version because I was too impatient to wait until it was officially available in the US, but I had to come here and share my thoughts about the XZ1. First of all, this is finally what feels like a truly matured phone from Sony. From design to camera, it finally feels like Sony has something that can compete with the rest of the phones out there. I'm gonna break up my thoughts below by pros and cons. Pros: - I love the updated design with its curved back and slim profile. The phone is much easier to hold in the hand. - The display, even for a 1080p, it's gorgeous and more than what any mobile user needs. The color enhancements give you enough options to customize it to your liking. - HDR support on Amazon Prime and Youtube is sweet. - The battery is crazy good. I had the S8+ and it would only last from 6am to 9pm before I needed to recharge on a normal work day with heavy use. Not sure what Sony (and Oreo) did, but I can make it to 9pm and still packing 45% of the battery. CRAZY good. - The software is the usual smooth as silk from Sony. The light enhancements on top of the stock Android add character but doesn't take away from the performance in the least bit when compared to the Pixel. - The camera experience has been dramatically improved over the past Xperia phones. I tried out the XZs and hated the camera, and while the XZ1 packs the same camera sensor, they finally did something with the post processing and the results are impressive. The camera shutter is much more responsive, so no more missed or blurry shots. - The slow video is a cool feature, but you can only take advantage of it in good lighting. - Sony has the best fingerprint scanner implementation, period. Having it built as part of the power button is in the most ideal location and it's crazy fast and accurate. - Headphone jacks are still great, and I'm glad to see Sony isn't jumping on that bandwagon yet. Cons: - I'm not on the same anti-bezel craze that everyone is on, but it would be nice to see Sony start to move in that direction. I personally feel like the phone is much easier to use when compared to the S8+ and the likes, so I could care less either way. - The stereo speakers are nice and loud, but a little too \"high\" in note. - [UPDATE AFTER 1 WEEK OF USE] I'm noticing that the display's oleophobic (anti-fingerprint) coating isn't as good as some other phones. The screen gets packed with fingerprints very easily. It's definitely worse when compared to the Samsung or iPhone and much worse compared to the OnePlus 3T (which had the best oleophobic coating of any phone I've ever used). Again, you're probably saying \"those bezels in 2017?\" Don't, and don't get turned off by them. The phone is still a beautiful piece of hardware and the usability beats any edge-to-edge display.",

            "body": "I got this phone in \"Used - Like New\" condition from the Amazon Warehouse and it came with the original box and accessories. The phone was in great condition with no noticeable flaws, so that was nice to see. As for the phone itself, it's pretty good, even now in late-2018. As has been mentioned a bunch before, the fingerprint sensor doesn't work on US models, so take that as you will. Flashing other firmware to enable it is possible, but I didn't feel like going through the hassle. I'm glad it keeps the headphone jack, the last Sony flagship to do so I believe. The software is nice with almost no major bloatware, aside from a few pre-installed apps, which can easily be disabled for the most part. The phone is also running Android 9.0 Pie, which is cool to see and Sony is fairly good about putting out security updates each month, although for how much longer that will continue is hard to say. There's no OLED display, just LCD, but Sony makes some amazing looking displays, so it hardly matters in this case. Battery life has also been good, not fantastic, but good. Sony's \"Stamina\" mode definitely helps to extend battery life when necessary. There are some other software tweaks that Sony has done which help make the things run more smoothly, but nothing major enough to distract from the standard Android experience. Aside from the fingerprint sensor not working, the only other downside is the camera. It's not terrible, but for a 2017 phone, I certainly expected more. It can take some good shots outdoors with good lighting, but they're average quality at best. Software updates have only marginally improved things. Overall, just okay. With all that being said, if you're still looking for something good in 2018/19 and you're alright with an average camera and no fingerprint sensor by default, this is still a great phone that has the latest updates and doesn't skip a beat. For the right price, you can't go wrong with the XZ1.",

The selfie camera alone on this phone takes amazing pictures but I am getting quality shots like never before with any other phone which is great because we do a lot of hiking and camping and lake time and it doesn't make since to us to carry a huge camera around for awesome pictures. The phone with minimal use gets 3-4 days of battery and even when streaming or heavy use sti gets a full 2+ days. The quality I have always seen from Sony phones is here with the performance that makes me laugh at those who pay 2-3 times as much for inferior phones. Best buy I have made in quite some time.",

Camera is superb, still learning it but continue to get compliments on the photos I've taken using it. Plus the design is great and very nicely sticks out in a world full of iPhones and Galaxies. \ud83d\ude01",

            "body": "Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser. \u00a0INTRODUCTION Sony has a small percentage of the US Android market. They have no carrier relationships to speak of, which puts them behind the eight ball when competing with Samsung, Apple, LG, and even smaller companies like HTC or Google (a small phone company, anyway). And so they are relying on direct sales through online retailers like Amazon to reach us. Should we care? Is there a reason to choose them over one of the bigger players? DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY Sony is not trying to woo new consumers with its design. Sony has been sticking with its \u201cOmni-balance\u201d look for at least five years now. On the one hand, this means a Sony phone is instantly recognizable. Tall-ish top and bottom bezels, smooth edges, premium finishes and colors. The Xz1 body is sculpted from one piece of aluminum, with a smooth, curved glass transition to the Gorilla Glass 5 front panel. The whole phone feels incredibly thin, but not light and plasticky. It is really smooth and slippery, though, so a TPU case at minimum might be a good idea. The metal body remains cool to the touch, even under moderate load. Size-wise, it is slightly larger than a regular iPhone (see pictures). The phone is water- and dust-proof to an IP68 rating. The screen is the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, not the 18:9 stretched screen that seems to have caught on lately on the trendier small bezel phones. Buttons are placed as along the right side, with a volume rocker, flat power button, and dedicated two step camera button. The power button contains a fingerprint sensor. It is not enabled on US models of this phone. This might be the biggest knock on this model for US consumers. Apparently Sony has some sort of legal issue in the US that they can't or won\u2019t resolve. The sensor is great \u2013 fast, accurate, and placed much more sensibly than other phones. As such, if you buy this phone for any of the other (quite valid) reasons, you should consider either choosing the international version, or researching how to flash the UK ROM that enables it. There is also no wireless charging. The bezels allow for a nice pair of front firing stereo speakers, that do a fine job with YouTube, music, and speaker phone calls. The headphone jack along the top provides excellent sound with both the earbuds (not included) and the over-ear headphones I tried. All in all, this is a design that Sony fans will love, average consumers will likely respect but not lust after, and anti-bezel partisans will loathe. But it is premium and solid all the way. Truthfully, the bezels aren\u2019t all that big, being about the same as an iPhone 7 or 8, and the black model ends up looking like an infinity display, too, at least with a dark wallpaper that lets the screen blend into the surround glass, such as the default Xperia Loops animated background. DISPLAY Speaking of the display, it is a 5.2\u201d IPS LCD panel with a 1920x1080 resolution. I can tell you, that with 20/20 vision, the pixels are not apparent at normal or even close-up viewing distances. Color and contrast are excellent, almost looking like an OLED panel. The display gets very bright when it is in a bright place, but also dark enough to be comfortable in a dark room. Sony has really nailed the adaptive backlight, it almost always chooses exactly the right brightness for maximum beauty and legibility. BATTERY LIFE The battery pack is only 2,700 MaH, but it easily provides an all-day charge, even with moderate to heavy use. Also included are two nice software optimizations. Stamina Mode does a great job of reducing background activity to give the user a good extra hour or so in a pinch (or even more if you engage the Ultra Stamina Mode, which renders the smartphone functions inert, like a feature phone). The other big addition is Battery Care, which learns your charging schedule and predicts when you will be taking it off the charger in the morning, let\u2019s say. So, knowing this, it slow charges your phone and lets it hover around 90%, which puts less stress on the battery. Then it quickly tops off in the last hour or so before you unplug. You can easily disable this on a case-by-case or on a more permanent basis. CAMERA This is my number one priority in a smartphone. It\u2019s the camera you always have with you, and as such I want any smartphone I use to be at least competitive with a dedicated point-and-shoot. This camera is most certainly at that level. The 19 megapixel \u201cMotion Eye\u201d sensor is capable of taking good pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. The daylight shots are bristling with detail, and are nowhere near as aggressively sharpened as some of Sony\u2019s prior cameras. Low light and indoor lighting shots are good, but not great. Noise is commendably low, though detail is reduced, as it is with practically every smartphone competitor\u2019s camera. There is a single LED flash which can help out, but it has a tendency to wash out a subject or thrown the contrast out of whack a bit, so I prefer to only use it in a pinch. I will say, though, that Superior Auto (the default shooting mode) still occasionally monkeys around with large facial portraits in an unacceptable manner, showing some sort of digital smoothing, and as such, manual mode might be a better bet for people\u2019s faces. But those are not the camera\u2019s unique selling points. The \u201cMotion Eye\u201d moniker comes from the stacked RAM memory built right into the sensor, which acts as an ultra fast buffer, allowing some interesting effects tied to speed. First is 960 fps slow motion. Most competitors top out at 240 fps, so this is a full 4 times slower. Although it is limited to 720p and records just a fraction of a second, stretched out to about 5 seconds (probably for storage reasons), the effect can truly be stunning once you get the timing right. Ocean waves, birds in flight, kids jumping, all look like professionally done slow motion footage as long as you are filming in bright light. The resulting video can either be a short slow-mo clip or a regular movie clip with bursts of 960fps. It\u2019s seamless and a lot of fun to share online. Other differentiating features on this model include adaptive focus tracking/10fps burst mode, and 3D scanning. The focus tracking keeps a moving subject like a child in focus over the course of a ten-shot burst. It works really nicely. 3D scanning allows you to pan around a person or an object and scan it in 3D - meaning, you will end up with a computerized image you can turn in any direction, like a video game 3D model. In fact, Sony will be integrating these scans with its various PS4 properties, as well as offering you a 3D printing service to create a bust of your favorite someone. It\u2019s really pretty cool, though probably not much more than a novelty, and it is pretty difficult to get a good looking scan. The slow-mo and burst modes are far more useful with currently available use cases. I've included some snaps from the camera and slow motion video. Check the comments for an imgur link to full-size images and a link to better quality video. PERFORMANCE The XZ1 is powered by a Snapdragon 835 CPU and has 4gb of RAM. 64gb of storage is onboard (expandable via micro SD up to 256gb), with about 10gb used for system software \u2013 Android Oreo. Suffice it to say, this is the CPU that powers every flagship, and it is completely and totally smooth and fast here. I could not get the phone to lag or stutter at all, no matter what I did. Games, camera, 3D scanning, everything. Sony\u2019s skin of Android is really minimal, with only a few additional Sony apps included, along with Facebook, Netflix and Amazon. Sony\u2019s apps tend to duplicate Google\u2019s, but a few of them are really good, like the Album app that sorts photos. OVERALL VALUE AND CONCLUSION This is an expensive phone. Now, Sony\u2019s phones tend to drop in price pretty quickly, perhaps because they keep releasing them on a 6 month schedule. But the price puts it in competition with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel. So does it justify that price? The XZ1 performs as well as those flagships and has similar if not better battery life. Design-wise it is quite nice looking, though it doesn\u2019t feature the trendy bezel-less look. The camera performs at around the same level as those flagships. It does a few things those phones\u2019 cameras can\u2019t, like 960fps slow-motion and 3D scanning. Its waterproofing is as good or better than most competitors. The US model has a disabled fingerprint scanner, which is a real bummer. I think this phone should be retailing for maybe $50-100 less than it is (which, based on past history, it will within 3-6 months). That would make it attractive enough to break through and overcome Sony's lack of carrier relationships. At its current price, it\u2019s a very good phone with cutting edge specs that doesn\u2019t differentiate itself all that much, and is missing one key element (the fingerprint scanner). For a Sony fan, this is a slam dunk. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of hardware that performs with no compromises and justifies its price tag. For an Android fan, this is one of the first phones shipping with 8.0 Oreo, and it competes well with other flagships. But you may want to wait for a deal to jump on it.",

What ruins this phone for me. Bezels- So to start with everyone talks about it but you don't realize it until you see it are the bezels, now I'm not looking for a bezelless display but this thing is ridiculous, there are 7 year old phones running symbian that have smaller sized bezels than this phone does. Photos and videos don't do it justice you have to get this thing in your hands and use it to understand how bad it is. It makes the device unnecessarily big, the screen feel smaller than it really is, and it makes the device looks cheap. Camera- On paper the camera should be great but in real world use it's just average at best. It doesn't perform particularly well in low light and no matter what the lighting conditions are pictures turn out blurry for some reason. I know it doesn't have optical image stabilization but neither do my other phones and I don't that issue with them. Bottom line the camera is good but it doesn't feel like it should be on a flagship phone at least not one in 2017. Sony apps- These things are annoying they constantly pop up with ads trying to get you to buy stuff you don't want and on top of that the stuff they sell is broken, for example the themes after a few days glitch out and don't display properly unless you reset your phone and on top of it you have to pay for them. The worst part is you can't disable or uninstall these, you might be able to disable notifications from them but they are always there. I paid $700 for a device only for it to show me ads? If I wanted that I would have brought a prime phone! Honestly I could keep going on like how the display is average, no fingerprint scanner, and the also mediocre battery life but I think you get the point by now. For $600 I would bump my rating up from 3 stars up to 4 but I didn't pay the $600 no I paid the $742 which is what this device cost when it came out just two months ago. The only real positives I can say about this device is the build quality is fantastic, the processor is top of the line, and the speakers are better than at least 95% of phones today. everything else is just bleh.",

            "body": "This is a quality phone that can compete with others in this price range. It doesn't really stand out, but it doesn't fall short either. Whether you want the phone or not might just come down to how you feel about the design, with its larger bezel and sleek black slab design. At 1080p the resolution is nothing special for a phone that costs 600+, but how many pixels do you really need on a screen this size? Sony screens have really vibrant colors and deep blacks, and look great. But if you feel you really need a super high def screen you can look elsewhere. It really runs smoothly and can handle any program from games to apps that I throw at it. With its metallic straight back and front and slightly rounded edges it feels comfortable in the hand. Battery life is also excellent. I can often get two days of use out of it without needing to charge it. The 19mp camera takes sharp, detailed photographs, even when the light is a bit low. One major shortcoming is the lack of a fingerprint scanner. I've read if you have some tech savvy you can unlock that ability. The phone is capable of scanning your fingerprint,but that's been disabled in some markets including the US due to patent issues. That and the phones design might be the deciding issue on whether you buy it or not. It does have a large bezel, while other high end phones seem to be moving towards no bezel designs. Personally I like the sleek, no frills slab like design.",

The music app from Sony is second-to-none. It is integrated with Spotify too and is the most seamless I've ever used. The only negative is the camera. Low light photos are limited... And the resolution is not as great as you'd expect from Sony. I'm a DSLR user and don't rely on my phone for images, so I personally don't care. Don't get me wrong, image quality is still 8/10 overall, but if you're a person that takes 50 gb of photos on your phone you might wanna look elsewhere. The front facing camera is 10/10 though.

            "title_review": "Rock solid phone that's almost exactly what it's trying to be",
            "body": "Sony\u2019s new Xperia XZ1 delivers what you would expect from a Sony flagship - rock solid performance that\u2019s not quite best in class, together with a distinctive design that you\u2019ll either love or hate. Basic details. In case you\u2019re wondering, this takes a nano-sim, charges through a USB-C port, and accepts microSDXC memory. (You can use the memory slot either for expanded memory or for a second sim). What\u2019s great: - The phone is blazing fast, and somehow gets very good battery life out of a 2700 mAh battery. I'm a heavy user, and I can't quite make it to the end of day, but that's a lot longer than most android phones, and I suspect you could get a full day out of normal use. There are a huge number of battery settings, so you definitely have a lot of control of performance vs lifetime. - It\u2019s designed with Asian flexibility: two sim card slots for any double-sim users, or you can put up to 256 mb of microSDX memory in the second sim slot to supplement the onboard 64 mb of memory. The controllers are quite good - I appreciate that there's a dedicated camera button for when you want to capture a shot right away in addition to a volume rocker and power button/fingerprint scanner. - The OS is very clean - this is one of the first phones to get Android 8, and has a clean version that's a pleasure to use. With the exception of an annoying sporadic \"Google connectivity services has stopped working\" error (that doesn't seem to actually prevent any services from working), I haven't seen any problems at all - between the fast hardware and the clean OS, everything just works. - Although not directly relevant to this model, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Sony also makes one of the only high end compact android models, this phone\u2019s sister model, the Xperia XZ1 Compact. While I\u2019m OK with a 5.2 inch screen (plus bezels!) people looking for a one-hand phone should definitely check that out. What\u2019s (very) good: - Screen: The screen is a 1080p LCD with HDR support. It looks very good, but there are better screens on the market. I actually think this is a good compromise, as the (relatively) limited screen increases battery life and speed, and looks great from my perspective, but if you want the absolute best looking screen you can get, this isn\u2019t it.. - Camera: This packs a 19MP, 4k video camera on the back, with special software to take slow motion segments, burst shots, and various features designed to get better shots in motion and low light conditions. The pictures are certainly the best out of any phone I've owned, but Sony is still disappointing in low light condition, and from what I read, some of the competition's top end cameras take better pictures under low light conditions. - Speakers: Front stereo speakers produce relatively good sound for a phone. \"For a phone\" being the key qualifier - the speakers are still tinny compared to real speakers or a headset, but they're not bad. - Waterproof: This is rated IP65/68, which means it has successfully been tested resisting every possible size of dust as well as jets of water and submersion under at least a meter of water. You can wash this phone off under a flowing tap, and you can drop it in the sink without water damage. (Note that Sony doesn\u2019t recommend using your phone underwater, and that it\u2019s very important that your USB port be completely dry before you start to charge.) What could be better - Fingerprint sensor. My understanding is that due to a patent dispute, Sony phones like this one have their fingerprint sensor intentionally disabled in the US software. Unless you're prepared for some OS hacking, that means no fingerprint sensor, which is a drag. - Bezels: The new trend is for bezel-less phones, but Sony is bucking that trend (for now) It gives you a place to hold the phone, and allows for a very slim phone, but they do stand out. - XPeria Mobile Transfer: This is the second Xperia model my family has gotten, and I've never gotten Xperia Mobile Transfer to work. This time, I tried to transfer call logs and texts from my Nexus 6P - I probably tried 12 times, including wireless, PC, and NFC several times each, but could never get it to transfer. (I got to step 5 of 6 several times, though!) Finally I just used easybackup and dropbox. All in all, this is a nice piece of hardware. It's reliable, clean and fast and pretty good at everything it does. You can get a better camera, screen or speaker package if that's your thing, but this is a reasonable compromise and a phone I'm planning to use for at least a few years.",

            "title_review": "Sony Xperia XZ1: no alarm, can't answer calls, screen brightness flickers, GPS doesn't work on a daily basis, and CRAP SUPPORT f",
            "body": "Since I got this phone I am seeing nothing but crap functionality on the device, and crap support forum Sony (aka: 90% of solutions suggested are \"update software\") and I seriously regret my purchase... Since I bought the Xperia XZ1 the following issues have arisen: 1) Alarm clock DOES NOT RING no matter what I do.. whether it's single-time or repeating alarms (I actually use my old Z5 as a alarm clock!). Already did 3 software updates (as per Sony's forums) and none of them worked! 2) Even BASIC PHONE FUNCTIONALITY is broken, as there is about a 75% chance that ANY CALL I get, I am unable to answer as the touchscreen freezes/stops working, and I have to try and relock/unlock 3 or 4 times until it actually responds (if at all!). 3) The \"Adaptive Display\" has become INFURIATING, as it doesn\u2019t stop changing screen brightness up and down even when I don't move it at all! And turning it off is not even an option, as the screen the screen is LITERALLY invisible if I'm using the same setting between going outside and into my car, for example. I've tried backlight control and without it, and tried every setting i could find.. NOTHING. And just having it at high brightness all the time is not an option either since THE BATTERY DRAINS LIKE A SEWAGE PIPE! 4) I have PROVEN beyond a doubt in my mind and out of personal experience that Sony's software updates DO actually SLOW DOWN THE PHONE! After being happy with my Xperia Z5, thinking it just slowed down over a couple of years of use, it took a bad fall and the sim card stopped working properly (signal comes and goes)...And since \"fixing it\" was literally more expensive than buying a new one, I went out and bought an exact same BRAND NEW Xperia Z5 out of the box for 200 less. It was working GREAT. However, I kept getting notifications to update the software, so I did... after doing about 5 or 6 updates in a row, the phone LITERALLY went down to the EXACT SAME turtle-slow speed as the 2-YEAR-OLD one!!!! I've tried EVERYTHING, and until now the phone is as slow, sluggish and laggy as the phone I abused for over 2 years! Sony is OBVIOUSLY guilty of slowing phones down with their updates! 5) The GPS is absolute GARBAGE on this phone! On a DAILY basis the phone GPS stops working and just can't find a GPS signal on ALL apps that use GPS. I've tried everything from software updates to deleting cache to uninstalling and reinstalling apps...etc. NOTHING. And this all in the exact same house, office, and destinations I go to every day, and had used my old Z5 with no issues whatsoever, and still do! 6) The last and most important point is the fact that Sony keeps trying to FORCE ME to do MORE software updates, and I know FOR A FACT from personal experience that the software updates constantly slow down the phone, AND there is a high chance of them screwing something ELSE up. And yet, I still did 3 updates so far hoping it will fix ANY of these issues.. not ONE of them was resolved! Oh, and all this was posted on the Sony forums for support.. not even ONE reply from any of their support teams. So what the )(*&^!#*%^!#*)& is wrong with Sony?! Conclusion... Sony Never Again!",

            "body": "This could have been one of the best phones out right now, but poor screen quality ruins that. If you look closely you will notice that the screen is full of fine crossdiagonal lines. It looks like the position of the individual pixels generate these lines. Also, the lux sensor or the screen brightness adjustment is behaving as it should be a beta product. When the screen brightness adjusts according to the lighting environment, it does not shift smoothly, but in very annoying jumps. Can be avoided by having a fixt brightness level, but that is not good enough for a flagship phone. Also, Sony just dismisses these claims. Worst customer care. I have checked several other phones (same model) in shops, and they all have this same problem. It is a manufacturing/design issue. To bad. Zoom in on the attached photo and you can see the lines.",

For the first reason it works as expected, but the 3-D software is nothing but annoying. It takes you through all these step by step training courses that are painful to get through. It is a fast phone, and the camera works great. I tried to find a case for it but there were none out yet. A few listed as though they were for the phone, but the holes for the camera were not right. I will have to wait until I get a case to use it for anything other than a development tool at my desk. It is very thin, light, and easy to drop. I have already dropped it several times onto the carpet. Overall, I think the price may be a little high for what you are getting, but it is a really nice Android device.",

            "title_review": "A good hardware with incomplete software",
            "body": "This is a dual-SIM Sony model G8342, codename Poplar_US, Customization Version 1310-4358_R5B. As of November 2017 this phone runs on Sony build 47.1.A.2.374, Oreo 8.0.0, 2017-10-01 patch level. This is important: You may not be able to update the phone to October update over the air, but instead use official XPERIA Companion application from Sony and perform device reset. You definitely want to update your device to the latest version, since it fixes Camera freezes in third-party applications and stops Launcher from fighting you. Summary after almost a month of use: You should get this phone if: \u2022 You like metal design and screen size, and \u2022 You don't mind taking pictures of mediocre quality (not potato, but details are regularly lost), and \u2022 You must use two SIM cards, and \u2022 You live in an area with good 2G/3G coverage for regular phone calls, and \u2022 You don't need Wi-Fi calling or VoLTE. \u2022 You want HDR-capable screen. Otherwise, get the\u00a0XPERIA XZ1 Compact\u00a0or wait for other phones with Oreo. We probably should have got the Single-SIM variant, which had a higher chance of supporting Wi-Fi calling and VoLTE, but G8342 is what we now have to deal with. I am returning the phone and plan to get XPERIA XZ1 Compact instead, which has VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling listed as officially supported with a single SIM card. The Good: \u2022 Great screen which can slightly alter colors if the device detects broad daylight (see photo). You can adjust the color temperature and even switch between color profiles. \u2022 This is the first Android Oreo phone that comes with a headphone jack. You don't hear the hissing noise/clicks when DAC is turned on/off, and the sound feels... different. I like it. \u2022 Camera button, which works in lock screen as well. \u2022 Front-facing speakers that produce sound you are unlikely to cover with your fingers. \u2022 Android Auto works great. \u2022 Front-facing camera is a widescreen one, so it fits more of your face and people around you. The Bad: \u2022 The phone is not provisioned for VoLTE in the US market, so you won't have HD Audio, probably due to Dual-SIM support and lack of Sony interest. This makes this phone unusable for calls in areas where LTE is the only option available (such as in areas where only LTE Band 12 is deployed by T-Mobile). \u2022 The phone is not provisioned for Wi-Fi calling, so you won't be able to make or receive voice calls if you don't have cell coverage, also possibly due to Dual-SIM configuration. \u2022 You'll appreciate the headphone jack, since bluetooth may be unstable, depending on the device you're pairing with. \u2022 After a week the following stopped bothering me that much, but the status bar Wi-Fi and mobile internet icons display up/down arrows when activity happens. Unfortunately, when arrows show/hide, the icons to the left are shifted back and forth. The Ugly: \u2022 The main camera seems to be worse at details than LG Nexus 5 of 2013 (see sample image, top is XZ1, bottom is Nexus 5). It introduces noise and grain due to over-sharpening which cannot be turned off (don\u2019t forget to complain about that to XPERIA Support). Those are not just JPEG artifacts, or settings you can adjust. You may be tempted to try other camera apps, but that won\u2019t fix the issue. Additionally, camera produces wide-angle distortions, but Sony publicly announced an upcoming fix for that as a setting. Accessories: Unfortunately, neither TechArmor nor RhinoShield have plans to support this phone and Spigen did not react to my question to confirm or deny they are going to bring XZ1 accessories to the US and the currently available selection is disappointing. \u2022\u00a0Skinomi TechSkin Full Coverage Screen Protector\u00a0- This is a soft film protector, which should help from scratches and does not change visibility. \u2022\u00a0Vigeer Crystal Clear Soft TPU Bumper\u00a0- This is an OK case which will definitely protect the phone, but soft TPU sticks to other plastic (such as badge holders) and looks stretchy. \u2022\u00a0Roxfit Ultra Slim Soft Touch Shell\u00a0- This case feels good in hand, but provides protection mostly to the back and the sides of the phone and not so much for the front due to minimal lip.",

Sony didn't cheap on any of the parts, the phone doesn't overheat like my iPhone did.

Very easy to set up as well, since its Android everything transferred over from her old phone. Its the first phone to ship with Android Oreo 8.0, an that OS is nice and fast. The battery life is pretty good too - she can go almost 2 days without charging and she uses it a lot. The camera is really nice too, 19mp. Takes good pictures. While it does not have the flashy features of Samsung and Apple phones, this is a really good phone for the money. I would say even better than much of the competition.

Really liked the fingerprint reader on the old phone and it had also died recently. So I got this phone as a replacement. Man do I miss my old phone. The fingerprint reader was there during setup, then disappeared after it realized it was in the US. I know I can hack the system and download other country's OK, but why should I need to go through this. Can you imagine Apple users being asked to do this? There is no \"star\" feature on the text message to avoid deleting important texts, the address book's up/down slider is all odd - you have to flick down once, before you can use it. Once you start typing a text message, you can't tell which SIM it will use and you can't change the choice even if it is wrong.They took away the SIP phone (which was lumpy, but worked once you got used to it). So many steps backwards. Oh, and a big deal for me, you can have dual SIM, or one SIM and a memory card, but not all three. And Sony, what is up with not being able to restore an Xperia backup from one generation to the next generation? Why do a backup at all using Sony software? I'd still rather have this phone than a Samsung because Sony updates the OS frequently which I think is important, but otherwise really really disappointed in the management decisions.",

Functionality : smooth, but some programs are buggy. I switched from CDMA company to GSM company, T-mobile. There are more phones to choose. Therefore I chose this phone. I am happy to be liberated from any service carrier Logo on phones and during booting. Note: My XPERIA package box states G8342 which is the same as the international edition No. Therefore I called Amazon. The Amazon rep said the product I received is the US warranty edition.

            "title_review": "Beautiful, fast but Android O glitchy",
            "body": "Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser. \u00a0The Sony Xperia XZ1 is an Android phone with impressive speed and features. However, for me, there are a few issues that make me wonder if switching from my iPhone to this smartphone was the right choice? Some of those things are Android-based issues and I'll try not to focus on them in this review. Truly the biggest caveats I have about this smartphone is its lack of a fingerprint security in the US model, grainy photos when using zoom, and the flimsy SIM card door. ------------------------------------------------------ \u2606 WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS PHONE \u2606 \u27a4 The HD 1080P display in 'Super Vivid Mode' is glorious! Whether viewing photos on Pinterest or watching 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' on Amazon Prime Video, the 5.2\" screen is a joy to view. \u27a4 It has NFC (Near Field Communication) which iPhones lack and I enjoy using for sharing photos and transferring files between my phone and my Sony Vaio laptop. \u27a4 The case is metal and very sturdy. \u27a4 It has 3D photo capabilities for faces, whole heads, food or objects. Your 3D captures can be sent off to be printed or used in animated videos. Sony promises even more with this tech in the future as AR becomes a big thing. \u27a4 This phone takes amazing slo-mo video in 6-second bursts at the highest frame rate available (920 frames-per-second) on a smartphone at this time. \u27a4 Tutorials on the phone for adding VPN and similar are very helpful. \u27a4 Extra-wide selfie shots from the 13 MP front-facing camera on this phone are great! \u27a4 Sharp photos from the up to 19 MP rear-facing camera (adjustable in Settings) are better than similar ones taken with my iPhone 5S. \u27a4 Call quality using Cricket Wireless (AT&T) is excellent. \u27a4 Was able to easily pair this phone with my Uconnect system on my 2017 Jeep Cherokee for calls and to receive texts through the system. \u27a4 The phone is fast when opening apps and using WiFi. The Android 8.0 Oreo operating system with the 835 Snapdragon processor is wonderful. \u27a4 Excellent battery life if making calls and texting with the occasional photo. (This drops off significantly if taking video.) \u27a4 In Settings, you can adjust your battery's STAMINA level. With a 'balanced' setting my phone lasted 25 hours. This setting restricted my use with 15% battery left per my settings. ULTRA STAMINA mode is also available and limits available apps to save on battery usage. \u27a4 The sound is excellent! Whether using Bluetooth headphones or without any headphones at all, you can enjoy watching videos both; audio and video, with this phone. \u27a4Xperia Tips are helpful! Use 'Assist' in Settings. \u27a4 The touchscreen is very responsive. \u27a4 The side buttons for power and volume are well places and have a good feel to them. \u27a4 It still has a 3.5mm headphone jack! \u27a4 LED Flash - great for selfies. \u27a4 Expandable storage up to 256GB with (not included micro SD card). \u27a4 Predictive autofocus and photo taking with smile recognition. \u27a4 Dual SIM card capability. \u27a4 The phone charges quickly via the included USB cable. \u27a4 LTE data works well on the phone as does WiFi. \u27a4 It's water-resistant up to 3'! This means if it falls in the toilet, you'll probably still be able to use it and you don't have to worry about using it in the rain. \u27a4 Automatic Backup of your phone can be set up within Settings to go to a cloud-based storage or the micro-SD card (not included) in your phone. --------------------------------------------- \u2600\ufe0e WHAT I WISH WAS BETTER \u2600\ufe0e \u27a4 NO FINGERPRINT READER? At least not if you are purchasing this phone in the US. Makes no sense to me Sony. Not at this price point anyway. **There are tutorials on YouTube about how to enable this feature, but this should not be attempted by novice techies as it is possible to damage your phone. ** \u27a4 Photos can appear dark and many needed 'automatic' adjustment to suit me. Good lighting = great photos with this phone. Low lighting = not so much. \u27a4 Zoom on the camera works fine, but photos taken with the zoom on tend to be noisy with a grainy quality to them. \u27a4 Despite being water-resistant, the door to the SIM card and micro-SD card slots is flimsy. The door on my phone broke off upon the first gentle opening of it. It still works, but it doesn't pull out and pivot as it should. \u27a4 Directions that come with the phone are terrible. Small, incomplete and pretty much useless. Watching YouTube videos helped me figure out the SIM card installation and I've done this sort of thing probably a dozen times before with other phones. Novices may want to take their unlocked Xperia to their network provider for installation. \u27a4 The 5.2\" screen is not edge to edge due to a slightly curved, rectangular bezel. \u27a4 Only 6 seconds of slo-mo video bursts can be taken. They are fantastic, but it's easy to miss the shot. See attached video to this review. \u27a4 The 3D scanning and resulting 3D images are cool, but not sure how to use them or why I need them. A novelty for sure! \u27a4 The design of the phone is very plain and may be underwhelming to some users. \u27a4 Not compatible with Boost Mobile, Verizon Wireless Prepaid or Virgin Mobile. Did get it to work on the Cricket Wireless and T-Mobile prepaid networks. \u27a4 Using this phone to text an iPhone has its issues (this is for all Android devices though). I had to install the Pulse App to try and get an iMessage experience across multiple platforms. Not thrilled with it, but it does work with both my Mac and PC too using a paid version of the app. \u27a4 Android Oreo is fast, but I've had the phone freeze up when using the calling app and photos. Calls don't go through or they go through and won't hang up, which is the worst part of it. ----------------------------------------------- In conclusion, there's a lot to like about the Sony Xperia ZX1 Unlocked *US version smartphone, but at this price point, I wonder if it's enough? I still can't decide. It certainly has a beautiful display, great cameras and is super-zippy in its performance. However, it lacks a fingerprint reader (can be enabled if you watch YouTube videos and are daring enough to try) in the US version which even with a 3D camera and water-resistance may be a dealbreaker for some. ---------------------------------------- NOTE: Video was taken at the 2017 Nike Invitational XC meet in Portland, Oregon on 9/30/17. It shows regular video taken from the Xperia ZX1 interspersed with 6-second bursts of 920 fps slow-motion video. ------------- 10/3/17: Off of Ebay I purchased a USA SONY Style Cover Touch SCTG50 case for this phone. It's on the Sony site, but currently not available for US buyers from other sources. The case was sixty bucks, but well worth it as it protects the back and the front of the phone without hindering its usage. And for those who are moving from an iOS to an Android device and missing iMessage, check out the Pulse App (paid version is eleven bucks for a lifetime subscription). I have it on my Mac and now can text from my Mac instead of picking up my phone to do it. Works on Mac and PC's as well as Android tablets and iOS tablets via a web browser. ------------------ 10/16/17: So I've been using this phone with the Style Cover Touch and I like it for not adding bulk and protecting both the screen and back. Not great for bounce protection though, and pricey. It does come with an app that enables either using the screen through the front flap or as a sleep-wake feature. The more I use this ZX1 the less I feel committed to using it for the long haul. Part of it is the providers I have in my local area. Maybe it's just a matter of hitting upon the right combination? I have enjoyed how it pairs and works seamlessly with my Uconnect system in my 2017 Jeep. And it does have a beautiful display. However, I've also noticed that while this phone while super fast, looks and sounds fabulous and takes nice photos - the operating system is not as stable as I'd wish it to be. Some other issues... The lack of support for messaging between the Android atmosphere and iOS. Yes, this is not the fault of the hardware, but rather software not playing nice, but it's darned annoying! Several times I've had to put down my phone and use my iPad to message my daughter who uses an iPhone as messaging just wasn't playing nice. Messages on my end would not send despite multiple retries. Despite the volume being 'up' on the phone, sometimes I find it difficult to get my ear over the speaker to have consistently good audio. The speakerphone is fine, but I don't always want that or to use a Bluetooth headset. The phone has frozen on me six different times. It has happened when I've been trying to answer a call. Sometimes with all the bells and whistles, it's tough to remember that calls are important too, but they are... at least for me. Maybe I'm just asking too much for seven hundred dollars? ===================================",

            "body": "As one of the first non-Pixel/Nexus phones to be sold with Android 8 (Oreo), I had expected to be surprised by some new changes in functionality, but it appears that most of the differences between Android 7 and 8 are under the hood, and I was able to start using the XZ1 right away without much of a learning curve. Upon setup, SONY offered to sign me up for its own services, but I decided to stay with what I was used to for the time being. The built-in launcher is fast and efficient, but again, for purposes of comparison, I installed the Google Now Launcher and the GBoard keyboard, so as to have a direct means of comparison with my previous phones. The default keyboard is Swift. There are a number of SONY apps pre-installed on the phone, but with the exception of the [media and photo] Album, I have stuck to the standard Google-provided apps. I have to say that this phone is very fast! I did not notice any lagging or stuttering of any kind. Fingerprint reader As many readers probably already know, the fingerprint reader has been disabled in the USA firmware for all of SONY\u2019s phones, due, as I understand it, to a patent restriction. This is unfortunate, but since I have not used a fingerprint reader on a regular basis, it was not really a problem for me personally. Speakers I listen to a lot of podcasts and radio, and the vast majority of telephone calls I make involve the use of the speakerphone, and here the results are somewhat mixed. Although the volume is generally sufficient, I can see that in a slightly noisier environment this may not be the case. The quality is pretty good, although there is noticeable distortion when the volume is turned up more than about \u00be of the way. There are a couple of audio effect modes that can be activated, although none of them seemed to particularly enhance the music that I listen to. It may be that the effects are more suited to game or movie soundtracks. Of recent phones that I\u2019ve tried, the far less expensive Alcatel Idol 5s had better quality and volume, as did the ZTE Axon 7. In an era when it seems to be gradually disappearing, I am glad to see that the 3.5mm headphone jack has been retained on the XZ1. Bluetooth The XZ1 seems to reliably connect to all the Bluetooth devices I\u2019ve tried it with, including a car audio system. The range is comparable to my other phones. EDIT: Oddly, no matter what the app being used for audio playback, remaining time for all tracks always appears as \"0:00\". Must be a limitation in the XZ1's implementation of Bluetooth. Screen The screen is a good size and is bright; I have no difficulty taking pictures outside in the sunlight. The resolution seems perfectly fine; the difference between this screen\u2019s resolution and the higher resolution of its predecessor is not great enough to be of concern to me. Camera ***[Edit 10/23/2017: There is some distortion of the captured image towards the edges of the frame. This is most noticeable when you are photographing a subject with a regular pattern. Sony has announced that they have a software fix to address the problem, and will be releasing it by November, 2017.]*** The camera is very fast, and has the sometimes-useful feature whereby it will take a picture or two before you or your subject are actually posed and \u201cready\u201d. This can sometimes result in a more natural shot, but it doesn\u2019t always work out that way, of course. The camera is very quick to focus, especially where there is sufficient light. I have not experimented with the super-slow-motion video, but you can find examples of it easily in video reviews of this phone. I do appreciate being able to use a button on the side of the phone as a shutter key. It appears that the camera can focus on a subject as close as about 6 cm from the lens. Telephony and Wi-Fi I have not noticed any problems with dropped calls or Wi-Fi connections, and the cell reception seems about on par with what my other phones can do in the same areas. Battery Despite the relatively small size of the battery, I have been able to use the phone all day (06:00-22:00) starting from a single full charge. After using the phone for a number of calls, browsing the web, listening to podcasts and casting via Chromecast each for about an hour, I still had upwards of 40% battery charge by 22:00. I understand that there have been additional optimizations in power management capabilities in Android 8, and this must be an example of those improvements. Undoubtedly the fact that the screen is not of ultra-high resolution must be a factor as well. SONY has claimed that the specialized charging circuitry used helps to increase the long-term life of the battery, and there are a couple of modes that can be enabled if you are running short and cannot recharge the phone. Overall The phone feels good in the hand and has enough weight so that it inspires confidence in its construction. That said, I bought a clear TPU case for a better grip. The case also adds a millimeter or two to the thickness, which makes it easier to pick up the phone when it\u2019s lying flat on a table. I like the fact that the buttons are located only on one side; when buttons are located on opposite sides I tend to accidentally touch one or the other. Conclusion The Sony Xperia XZ1 is an elegant, substantial phone. Both its general design and its specification are a good indication of its flagship status amongst SONY\u2019s current offerings.",

            "body": "I have always been a big fan of Apple products, but was looking for something a little more reasonable in price. The Xperia is a nice entry level smart phone. The pluses: 1. Setup took just a few minutes and I love that gmail is it's preferred email source. 2.This phone is very google friendly. 3. The font is really easy to read. 4 dialing and texting was much more easy than some of the other smart phones out there. 5. It holds a decent charge for several days. 6. The screen won't light up unless the user hits the command key. Some negatives: That same key is in an odd spot to turn the phone on or off. 2. The camera button is also in an odd spot. 3. The sim card slot is really flimsy. 4. password requires to hit the check mark for the phone to unlock. There are some cool features on the phone like slow motion video, though it is not a feature I would use much. This phone is a good alternative for someone that doesn't want to pay a high price, but still get some great reliable features.",

            "title_review": "Refurbished device gamble paid off!",
            "body": "I am so happy with this phone. I was a bit uneasy about buying a refurbished device, but my Galaxy Note 4 was broken, and I really did not want to shell out nearly $1K for the Note 8. So I figured I would try this refurbished S7 Edge and hope it would last long enough for the price to go down on the Note 8. This phone looks and works like brand new! I was able to contact Verizon and have them switch over to this device with no problems. About 24 hours after activating it, the phone did go through about 15 different software updates to bring it up to date, but I was expecting this to happen. After all the updates were finished, I did a quick wipe of the cache partition, and the phone has been working great. The package includes an adaptor for connecting to your old Samsung Galaxy phone to transfer all of your apps and data. I had all of my music on an SD card in my Note 4, and was able to move the card into the S7 Edge with no problems. The phone did not come with the little tool for opening the SD/SIM card slot, but I just used the post of an earring to easily open it (you can also just use a paperclip or a thumbtack). I've been using the phone for 2 weeks now, and all of the functions work flawlessly - calls, texts, apps, Bluetooth connectivity, everything. I had originally planned to only use this phone for a year or so, but I like it so much, I hope it lasts longer. One of my concerns with a refurbished device, especially one with a non-removable battery (the back of this particular phone does not easily pop open without specialized tools) was that the battery would already be old and would quickly die. I am happy to report that the battery in the phone that I received lasts a really long time. It would probably last several days in standby/light usage, and it easily lasts a day and half for me with heavy usage and lots of video streaming. It comes with a Samsung Fast charging cable, and I have subsequently purchased the Samsung Wireless Charger to charge it wirelessly, and that works perfectly, too. If you are hesitating for the same reasons I was, I can recommend this device with no reservations.",

I had a refurb Samsung Core Galaxy Prime which worked ok for my needs but using Google Maps would freeze up or lag a lot and some apps will no longer work with the older android. I wanted something faster for GPS as well as something that supported wifi calling. I decided to go with a refurb as I had good luck last time and I ended up with the Galaxy S7 Edge. I was going to buy something cheaper like the J7 and I probably would've been fine with that but hopefully this one is fast enough to warrant the upgrade. I bought a tracfone byop sim kit and called tracfone and transferred my number to the new phone. Unfortunately I found out that wifi calling doesn't work with most prepaid services (in my case I'm using cdma/verizon through tracfone). I need to buy a real verizon plan to use it apparently as the option is not listed in the phone options where it should be. I don't use many minutes in a month so it's cheaper to just go prepaid. While the screen looks good, I think the curved edge is a really dumb design. I don't know why they thought this was useful somehow...it just makes things hard to read when a letter happens to land right on the curve. I also feel like the screen protectors may not be as effective since it can't cover all 4 sides to the edge. I wish I had put more thought into that before purchasing it, I see absolutely no advantage to the curve. Size-wise it's actually a little too big for my tastes. I don't really get the desire for ultra-thin phones, it just makes it harder to hold onto. My old phone was held easily but this one is a bit awkward because of the height. In this case bigger is not better but I will just live with it rather than go through the return hassles. So far I'm not impressed by the battery life but that's very possibly due to all the updates going on for the first day or two. I don't think the fast charging is working with the supplied wall charger/usb cable, supposedly it's supposed to tell me when that's working? It seems to charge slower than my old phone. I will update when I've used it more and can gauge it better. Over I gave it 4 stars pending my updates based on the value since it's a refurb. The screen was in fine condition, no real wear on it. P.S. The seller says as a \"gift\" they put on a screen protector but it's REALLY bad. I seriously thought there was something wrong with the touchscreen when first using it because I had to press so hard to get buttons to respond, especially near the edge. It was extra annoying because I had to then clean off the sticky crap around the edges that the screen protector was held on with before I could put on a real tempered-glass protector that works. A good one cost me $10 and now the touchscreen works perfect. The seller needs to stop being cheap or not put a protector on at all. Edit: I have been getting very poor signal from Verizon so I tried to switch to a T-Mobile sim card and tracfone says it is not compatible with this phone and that it is locked to Verizon. I paid for an UNLOCKED phone that supposedly also supports GSM...now I can barely even receive calls and have no option to change carriers. This is unacceptable.",

I was really surprised how nice the phone was when received. I am a Quality Inspector, 30 yrs., and put my experienced eye on it. The only blemish I could find was a couple minute scratches near the USB port. I read bad reviews from people who said the phones didn't work. The wife has the same exact phone so I borrowed her SIM card. Turned it on and it fired right up, connected to the network. Everything worked as is should. Display is beautiful, clear and sharp. I've only had it for 3 days so I can't comment on breakdowns. Battery life seems to same or similar to the wife's. Would I buy a phone this way again?....maybe. Time will tell.",

            "body": "So, I always buy phones outright and normally a model or two behind. To me that makes the most sense financially. When I chose the S7 edge it was replacing my S6 edge that has developed a less responsive screen and a thin purple line running down my phone. When this one came it looked to be in great condition, no scratches or dents. I turned it on and since it was refurbished I was expecting some imperfections, and the only significant one I've noticed was that the icons in the bottom of the screen (phone, text, internet, apps) were burned into the screen as if someone left the brightness on the highest setting and just let the phone sit on the home screen for a day. I could/can see them no matter what I had displayed on my phone. I could overlook it, so I did. But less than a year after purchase I am experiencing the same thin purple line running along the length of the screen which is really disheartening. I do keep my phone in a protective case and have very minimal dropping of it, so I'm not sure what the cause of it is. So, it's a good purchase for me, because I prefer not to pay $800+ for a cellphone, but the defects are something to take note of if you are ordering refurbished goods.",

            "body": "I have had nothing but great luck and service with these certified refurbs. This is my 9th or 10th one. Always great quality and outstanding service.. This phone had some issues with arrival as FedEx refused to deliver at a time when I was home. I finally worked it out but all I can say is the FedEx is by far the worst delivery service on the face of the earth. That being said the phone is wonderful. I am replacing a S7 so I wasn't expecting much difference. My S7 and I really didn't get along great and I often had funny software quirks that would change settings on me without my permission. Ithe took me a while but I had finally gotten it to a point where I was controlling the phone and not the other way around. I was worried that this phone would be the same way (we have another S7 in the family that behaves as it should). Push came to shove and I had to either leave Samsung or get another S7 (someone else on the plan needed a phone and mine was nominated lol) Well this phone has been amazing, It is so easy to use and setup was not a struggle as the transfer was seamless and easy. All my hard work getting the other S7 to behave transferred over and this phone is a dream. The software runs fast and reminds me of the early days of Android (original Motorola Droid user here!) with the easy customization available. The screen is amazing and looks so elegant with those smooth curved edges. THe edge swipe tray is an amazing feature and I am so in love with how it works. I like a very uncluttered home screen and that edge tray just makes it so easy to keep a nice tidy screen without having to dig around for commonly used apps. Samsung has a winner with this and I won't have a none edge phone again. Battery life is slightly better than S7 (larger battery) I get a full days use (moderate to heavy) on a single charge but when I go to bed the phone is screaming for juice (usually 10 to 15% left). Phone is so thin and easy to hold I really am debating about putting a case on it (I will as Im a klutz but man is the naked phone georgeous). My only real complaints are the same as the S7. Micro USB charging is so outdated. The wireless charging in g is spotty at best (you need perfect alignment on the base). the power on and volume buttons are too low on the case and I grab them all the time (even after having over a year on the regular S7). The bloatware is a little more manageable on this phone and I was able to delete some junk I won't use and disable a bunch also, but Samsung (and Verizon) put too much redundant garbage on these phones. SD and Sim card slot is a pain to use and the non replaceable battery should be outlawed as this is building a forced replacement into the phone and that should be illegal. There is not a suitable screen protector built for this phone .",

My only beef with samsung phones is how easy it is to hit the two buttons on the bottom of the face by accident. It's fast and does what I need. I still use my DSLR to take real photographs. Cannot beat the flexibility of the DSLR but I am a trained photographer. so have preferences and habits in taking my pix. Even though I'm a late boomer, tech savvy, I'm still getting used to having a camera at my fingertips when my phone there. BTW folks, consider NOT wearing your phone on your body, there are data indicating a link between cancer and the radiation emitted by phones and a lot of statements by the manufacturers and phone companies disputing them.

After spending an Hour and twenty minutes on the phone with Straight Talk trying to activate the phone I found out that this phone is NOT unlocked for use so this phone will NOT work on Straight Talk!",

I highly recommend getting a refurbished cell phone based on the fact that if there were any issues with the device, they have typically already been corrected for so you get the technology at a fraction of the cost. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend others consider this much more affordable option for calm phone replacement when the time comes to get yourself a new device!",

Upon reading reviews, their seems to be a pattern of issues with this company's refurbished phones from swollen batteries, over-heating, automatic shut downs, mother boards frying, fingerprint access issues and freezing. I did have a computer person look at it and he informed me that the formatting of the software when refurbished was done incorrectly.

If you are buying this phone expecting it to look like new as is claimed, then it is possible that you will not receive what you are looking for. However, this phone is still great and performs well. Plus, I have to give them credit for quick shipping. Overall, I would say that the phone is worth it because of the amount of money that you save as long as you can live with so minor scratching.",

            "body": "Ordered to replace a Samsung Galaxy S4. It arrived the next day as promised. The box was a generic box that looked sort of used however the phone inside was wrapped in a protective film with a generic cable and charger. The description of the phone did clearly say the original accessories would not necessarily be included. When I removed the protective film on the phone I checked carefully for damage or scratches and there were none. It looked like a new unused cell phone. The battery we partly charged so I plugged it in to charge it fully which it did without issue. The only issue I ran into was when I tried to secure a new SIM card. My S4 used a micro SIM and the S7 needs a nano SIM. I had to visit 4 Verizon locations to get the new card. It seems that Verizon vendors, which they have on every corner here, have little to no experience with this issue. One vender refused period, the second didn't have the card and the third installed an incorrect card and when they called a Verizon tech about it he told them the card was ok but it would take 5 days for the phone to be activated. As a Telco retiree I knew there was a problem but it wasn't the phone. After a call to the company, on my 4th visit to a Verizon location, I was finally able to secure the correct card and it was connected in minutes. So far this phone is awesome. There are bells and whistles that I am still trying to get used to but I am happy with my purchase. Hopefully that will continue to be the case. I mention the issues with the card because I can see where my contacts with this provider could throw doubt on this purchase for others.",

Too bad becuase otherwise I was happy with the phone but lack of SD support is fatal for my purposes.

The first is the charger, I don't believe I was supposed to get a Samsung charger but the one that shipped with the phone is an off brand that did not charge very fast, like 10% in one hour. I switched the charger to one of my older Samsung chargers and it charged much faster and completed the charge in a couple of hours. The second issue is that the SIM card for the S7 Edge is smaller than the one for my S5. If you go to a Verizon store (not an independent store) they will change it out for free which is what I did. Again not a huge deal, I may not have noticed if they mentioned it so it is fine. All in all it sure beats paying the price for a new phone.",

There are a few small, yet noticeable areas of damage on the display. I could live with this damage being on the opposite side of the phone much easier. For a refurbished product I would consider it average, given the condition.",

Obviously the biggest thing about the edge are the edges. Unfortunately about this, the edges are exposed. I only had mine for a month until it dropped a foot and the edge of the screen cracked, and I couldn't see the bottom half of my phone. Nice phone, but not practical. I wish I would have gotten the note instead. It is not worth the risk of cracking and damaging. The cost to repair is the same as as much as you pay for the phone.",

The phone would start itself when opening certain apps like netflix, but that was just the beginning. after about a month and a half after i bought it the phone went completely crazy, it would shut off randomly without it even being used, it would spend entire days and nights restarting itself over and over again. i took it to be fixed after one night it just stopped working entirely. i took it to get fixed, but i was told that there was nothing that could be done so now the phone sits in a drawer after a couple months of using it. my LG 3 lasted for nearly 4 years and this phone could not last 3 months.save yourself the trouble and money this phone will cost you.",

For a refurbished phone it looked brand new. No visible scratches, no cracks, and possibly most important NO AMOLED SCREEN BURN! If you're looking for quality don't buy a used smart phone without them being certified in some way as being refurbished, big mistake. This was worth the extra money to have a nice phone, nice accessories (fast charger, cable, usb attachment) and a warranty.",

The first one I received was in excellent physical condition and worked great until the fingerprint scanner stopped working on day 3. Called support, \"hardware issue\", had to return. Second phone was also in great physical condition but was missing factory apps that cannot be downloaded. Called support again. They contacted Samsung and Verizon and said software was not factory, \"possibly tampered with or counterfeit phone.\" Returned. Third phone arrived in less than great condition physically. Scratches on back and a small dark spot on the lower left hand corner of screen but everything seems to work ok. SUCCESS! Or so I thought. A couple weeks later, battery isn't holding charge nearly as well as first two phones. It's not horrible but I know firsthand what it should be and it's not living up. I don't want the hassle of returning again but I'm not pleased at all with Dealfisher.",

All you have to do is research the purple line problem for s7 edge on Google. The most promising fix you can do at home, you can't even do with a Verizon phone because they lock the secret codes.

Before I clicked \"Add to Cart\" I checked reviews and saw that DealFisher received positive reviews. I've had tablets for years but never really felt the need to own a smart phone. So I'm that \"odd bird\" who has the best tablet - and a Flip Phone! But it's summertime and I'm listening to a lot of Audible books while I'm outside. A tablet is just hard to keep up with. I knew I wanted a Galaxy S7, but didn't want to pay a high price. I was lucky enough to find the S7 Edge - at the right price - from a source who gets good reviews. I was not disappointed! It looks \"brand new\" - I'm very satisfied with the performance of the S7 and love that it's portable, so I can stick it in my pocket when I'm outside. I'm still running it from home wi-fi (not really excited about getting a bunch of 'love you' texts) - BUT I will choose a wireless network soon. Even though it boots up to Verizon I've read where I can choose the network I want. If you've read this far I'll give you another huge plus of phone versus tablet. I have Spectrum internet and take advantage of watching TV on a device. It is so nice to sit on the deck and catch up on today's news. Oh - and if you want one more reason to buy the S7 - it takes gorgeous photos. I do paper crafts. When I'm done with a project I take a photo so I can reproduce it later. I am so pleased with the results, I won't grab for my Nikon next time. OK, I'm done!",

            "body": "Ordered the 32gb verizon platinum gold s7 edge from BuySPRY. Pretty phone and display design but defective and scratched in important places. IMEI was clean, called verizon to check that first. I wish more reviewers would include their phone type purchased and seller they purchased from since there can be multiples of each at any given time. It came with Android 7.0. My phone has deep scratches over the home button/fingerprint reader. It overheats just from web browsing. After a few hours it used half the battery before I even added any contacts, pics apps, anything. You never know how old the battery is on these refurbished unfortunately. It freezes at times, screen unresponsive at times, dims randomly, will not add autopace when using the swype function on the Samsung keyboard in google unless it is the first web page or the widget on the home screen. Hitting the + to open another and all subsequent pages somehow deactivates autospace though it is on in settings, tried every fix I can online, nothing fixes this. Front camera makes my face look blurred and has a lot of distortion if you don't hold it at just the right angle. This is not a beautify setting but the camera itself. My old s4 is almost as fast which is pathetic. Again there's no personal data even on this phone yet. Does not come with nano sim, earbuds, adapter, or original fast adapter charger. If you only read the description you will think it comes with all relevant accessories. It only says what it does not come with in the Amazon refurbished phone policy. I received a charger marked Samsung with just over a 2 foot charging cable that won't reach from a wall plug to anywhere. It looks like the knock offs I have ordered from Amazon for my s4 that break every 2 months and don't fast charge. It did have a generic sim tray opener, essentially a paper clip. Waiting on a reply from the seller. Thank goodness this was shipped prime or I would really be stressing over whether I would get my money back. My s4 that has been dropped a million times and is ancient in phone age is better, not quite as fast, but only by a milliseconds on app launch and a few seconds more when loading graphics on web pages. It's hard to understand any excitement over this phone if you have owned a galaxy s older version. Oh and bonus, it stinks from whatever repair was done, guessing glue for a broken screen or something that clearly wasn't sufficient for it to be working properly. If you can buy this new within $100 more I think it's worth it so you have the 1 year Samsung warranty instead of just 90 days. You'll also get all the accessories and a real fast charger which can be hard to find an authentic replacement for. The knock offs really do not work the same. I learned this painfully with my s4 not charging or terribly slow and cables splitting open. Ugh.",

            "body": "Buying this phone was a mistake. The battery is terrible, and the phone barely even functions after a year. It will call and receive calls about 50% of the time, the other 50% of the time it will act like I don't even have a phone line. The phone also overheats like mad (I've literally burned myself from touching the screen on occasion). The battery starts draining really fast as it heats up, then processor throttles itself as it heats up. As that happens, the phone keeps warming up as you're trying to accomplish whatever simple task (e.g. browsing Chrome) and the cycle continues. The phone is completely unusable if you are not in power saver mode, because in just a few minutes this runaway cycle becomes a serious issue -- sometimes it will take me +5 minutes just to open up the camera app and successfully take one picture, even if I have not been using the phone, and in the process it will drain 10% while trying. At first it was ok (definitely not amazing), but it got exponentially worse over time. I later learned refurbished phones are not only half-assed during repair, or sometimes completely untouched if the problem can't be immediately determined, but the requirements for passing are terribly low. Recommendation: NEVER buy a refurbished phone, especially this one. Even if you don't notice the problems right away they will come up over time. Given all the other reviews here, this appears to be a common problem.",

My battery doesnt last NEARLY as long- I literally have to charge it multiple times in a day- its always in battery saving mode- That can't be normal. The final straw? My camera is crap. I thought maybe the lens got dirty or my case was covering it (my case doesn't cover it). Its progressively gotten worse and everything looks like it's some weird filter and the resultion is crap. Then I realized it's not even focusing correctly. Its been 2 months since I purchased this. I let a lot of things go as far as accepting the unacceptable, but the camera is truly a deal breaker.",

A quick Google search can help you with that. Also, for Voicemail, you have to go into the call settings and change the voicemail from *86 to your phone number or it'll say you are calling an international number. Other than that, the phone is perfect. The packaging was a little mashed up, but the box doesn't affect how I use it. The camera is amazing!! It's fast as far as using apps, but it's slow to charge and the battery life isn't the best but for what it is and the price, I couldn't be happier. So if you use Cricket, this phone WILL work!

The phone was promoted on Amazon as a Verizon phone (true) which was unlocked (true) ...as a GSM phone...not so accurate. Yes, it has GSM qualities, yet because it is a Verizon phone - its natural habitat is Verizon's not GSM. It took me 3 days and a contact with the company to understand that the reason my phone was not working on my GSM network is because it had not been adjusted for GSM! There was no indication in the packaging that this was the case and how to engage the difficulty and frustration I experienced in the phone not working on GSM. Contacted Tech Support.... yes, we have many phones returned because of this issue!? If that is the case - why not either alter the settings in shop, if folks are ordering a GSM phone or include instructions on how to adjust the settings on the phone?",

            "body": "I've always used androids but my favorite brand has been the Galaxy's. I have upgraded from the S4 only because they no longer make updates for the apps (I hate changing phones and only do so when I don't have any other choice). The S7 met and exceeded all my expectations. The battery keeps a great charge when on moderate power mode and charges quickly. The screen is big and beautiful. The cameras take decent pictures ( I'm no professional photographer so I find it acceptable). If I had to say anything negative... it would be that I have to push a little harder than I would like to on the touch screen... and this could very well be due to the phone case I purchased that has the screen protector built in. Overall, I'm very happy with this phone and will only upgrade to the next Galaxy when this one becomes obsolete.",

I eventually solved this by discovering the popup notice would not ( somehow ) allow the update to complete. It appeared to go through the machinations, but then the notice was back. Solved this by bypassing the popup and updating from the System menu. Of course, no support from seller. Amazon stepped up and applied their guarantee; kudos!! Second EDGE eventually developed a red line the length of the display. But, Amazon only offered a discount. So, I guess I have to live with a defective phone. While I applaud Amazon's efforts, the seller should have been made to replace it.",

I spilled a couple sips beer on mine and it had a seizure. Has a tight rubber phone case. Beer only hit the home screen button and got in there. So I question the water resistance..... especially after refurbishing. Battery lasts the 8 hr work day with 15 to 30% battery left after moderate reading on lunch, and checking gmail throughout the day. No games maybe a 5 min video with no sound using battery saving mode on half bright screen. Streaming or maps navigation kills it quick",

I will be contacting the reseller about this as it is getting worse by the day :-( also sadly this is not truly an \"unlocked\" phone. It is unlocked enough to use another carrier's SIM card , but it is full of Verizon bloatware and has many errors that AT&T and other carriers cannot work around because it was a Verizon phone. You cannot make a phone call or return one or use the voice mail anything like that unless you dial the whole number from a contact not from your history these are all Verizon bloatware issues not this seller it is just not made clear unfortunately this is a problem you will have to put up with. When I bought my first unlocked Motorola Droid it was truly unlocked with no carriers bloatware and I found it much faster and certainly fully functional. I would not purchase this phone again because of this.",

So it was completely useless as, you know, a phone. I returned it for a new one, and this time I got one with a broken headphone jack (which I didn't care too much about) and the phone was unable to tell when i tried to put it into landscape mode. I decided just to not bother anymore, and keep it. With this phone, I checked over everything. Orientation, camera, SIM and sd card, apps, mic, speaker, jack, usb, battery life--everything I thought could go wrong. Everything seemed perfectly in order. Works absolutely lovely. As for the phone itself, I highly recommend. Great battery life, smooth performance and feel, and I like that it can accept both a SIM and sd card at the same time, as I've seen many newer phones that can't.",

            "body": "I bought this phone expecting a great experience. I have a Pixel XL which I bought new 2 years ago and I wanted a new phone because mine was having battery life issues, but I didn't want to drop $1000 on a S9 or Note 9. Because this was refurbished and had a fresh copy of the Android operating system, I expected it to perform much better than my old phone. Instead, I was met with performance and battery life issues on a 2 year old flagship. I believe this is the fault of the refurbisher, which should have noticed the battery when they refurbished it. I also found 2 dead pixels on the screen, which DEFINITELY should have been noticed by the refurbisher before they sent out the phone. The whole point of buying a refurbished phone is that you get a phone at a discount, but with a guarantee that it doesn't have any hardware problems. This is the opposite of what refurbished stands for. Also, the refurbisher put a sticker on the back of the phone that left residue all over the glass... I am very disappointed and will be returning this phone and purchasing another S7 edge from somewhere else.",

            "body": "I read reviews of the Edge before buying it, and it all boiled down to guarding a bit more carefully than regular flat faced smart phones, because the rounded edges made the face more susceptible to cracking. Made sense--larger surface area, larger risk of cracking. I thought I could go in informed, and do this without issue. I should've listened, though. The impact glass guards you can get for Edge models pop right off after a couple hours, making that way to guard them useless. Any case that's not industrial grade will leave the edges exposed to impact damage. I can see how Samsung wanted the Edge model to be new and trendy, because yes, the concept of the edge notifications and menus is new and different. However, notice they didn't make another after the S7 Edge. I assume it's from the realization that their idea was shot. If all you do is go on your phone and hardly out of your house, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise, I don't recommend this phone at all.",

It was too dangerous to get in the water next to the boat with the waves slamming it around. We had to wait for 5.5 hours before the storm had subsided and it was dark. At 10PM, my son called my phone. We saw the glow and went down to get it. I pulled it out and was able to call my wife to tell her that we found it. The mic and speaker flooded initially and the phone diagnosed that there was water in the charging port. But we let it dry out in the sun the next morning, and it was good to go. That's impressive.

Within 3 days of use it stopped working for longer than 2 hours, for no reason, just froze until the battery died. Then, it kept on turning off in the middles of calls. By the third week of use the phone started resetting very often to a point that it did reset 3 times in a period of 5 minutes. This is the middle of the fourth week using it and it died for a whole day, I would try to charge it and nothing would come up. Finally, I managed to charge it, and I used it for 5 minutes until it died again. I can't believe it. This is a silly economy to make, real stressful.",

Mind you I would go and clear cache or data from apps on an almost daily basis to remove the low storage message. I also received the wrong color which Amazon did refund me a small percentage of my total. I'm just extremely dissapointed in this phone which I bought in December and I am back to my cheap $40 cricket phone that works way better! The phone is also to big for my hand \ud83d\ude02",

            "body": "This phone is slow. I've restarted I've reset. Aside from rooting and putting on something that plays better with the hardware I've done what I'm supposed to. It sucks because it feels like a solid phone. And if I wait patiently for apps to start, they look really nice on the screen. Like watching Youtube or Netflix looks really good, but if I tap the icon and then tap somewhere else it sort of just freezes. Also it gets really hot while charging sometimes. Perusing a forum like reddit will cause the phone to need a restart because it will just lock up. I had high hopes. I remember Nokia dominating the market. Maybe a software update will come out because I am stuck with this one for a while.",

I purchased this, and I didn't get an international version with the Samsung Exynos 9810 SOC (with the ARM Mali G72 GPU), which is what the description says. This contains the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SOC, just like the US version. In doing further research, this SM-9600 is \"an international version,\" just not \"the international version with the Samsung Exynos 9810 SOC, with the Arm Mali G72 GPU\" (i.e. it's not what fully what it was advertised as). According to TechWalls, this model is for China. However, when the one that I got first-boots, it appears to be configured for US Spanish. BTW, I never used it as a phone (i.e. I didn't plug in a SIM), but I did use it with WiFi. It seems like a great, 5-start phone. I just needed the version with the Mali G72 GPU.",

Biggest complaint is that this model came from Europe (not the UK) and the firmware load is missing a couple of key features, mainly the ability to do WiFi calling. A huge miss and something that should have been disclosed by the seller. The GSM signal reception on this phone is extremely poor and drops calls with regularity.

It came with Android 8.0 Oreo and I immediately upgraded to 9.0 Pie. Upgrade had 0 issues. Pie is a much better OS. One main like with Pie is the \"night mode\" which gets rid of that white screen in 8.0 for a black screen with white letters. MUCH better on the eyes. Took a while to customize settings to my liking, but once I did, I am super happy with the purchase. Few negatives in the supplied apps, but definitely not a deal breaker. Price has dropped since S10 release which now makes this super affordable-ish. No regrets. Samsung mobile forever!",

Also came with a usb-c to headphone adapter, and a usb-c to usb-a adapter, as well as a C to C cable. My only gripe so far is that the fingerprint scanner doesn't appear to work, of which I would normally use a lot. If this wasn't such a big deal for me, it'd be an obvious 5 star rating. If I get the fingerprint scanner working, or there are other issues, I will modify my review. It appears that I have gotten the scanner working, and i'm updating my review to 5 stars.",

I went from having full bars at all times, to having a single bar. It makes loud sounds, that sounds like a tornado warning alarm and will randomly reboot. Now I am facing the issue where I am unable to receive any data on my phone if I am on a phone call. It's a shame, I was very pleased with my first Google Pixel 2 phone that was unfortunately stolen. I purchased this one to replace it while my phone was still under contract at Verizon. It has done nothing but caused issues for me and has forever soured my preference of purchasing anything refurbished.",

Coming from the Galaxy S5, love the Pen, though I have not used it much, besides to write notes, which is nice because of the way its set up you can write notes straight to your home screen. I have set up my side bar with all the app I need quick access to, so that gives me a full screen to write notes on the fly. I doubt I will have any issues with this phone. I don't use the face recognition software, or fingerprint scanner/security so I have nothing to say about that.",

            "body": "I've been a Samsung Galaxy owner for quite a few years now. I even owned a Note 4 which I liked very much. I just upgraded from the Galaxy S8+ and have had this phone for about a week. I love it. The phone feels good in my hand; obviously I like large screen phones. It's powerful, the screen is crystal clear and the camera is excellent to say the least. Since I've only had the phone for a short time I have been playing with it quite a bit, setting it up and adding and using old and new apps. So the battery life I have found to be, still, pretty damn good. I expect that when I start to use it more normally as I have in the past that the battery life on this will exceed pretty much any phone that I've ever had before. One other point. In the past I never really used the Note stylus very much. However, one of the selling points on this model is how functional the stylus has become. I've used it for to take selfies and I love that I can copy text and photos from websites that don't allow you normally (I'm looking at you Instagram!) to copy and paste. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, I believe, for how you can use the stylus. I'm looking forward to finding more shortcuts and other features that I can use it for. I'm a pretty long-term Galaxy owner so I do have a little bias, but I believe I can still honestly say that this is one of the best phones available out there even for the price. And I can highly recommend it to anyone who likes a large phone with a long battery life and a beautiful screen and excellent camera! I hope this review has been helpful to some of you",

The phone itself is great. It's the SM-N960F which allows for dual sim cards. A few unfortunate things I've learned along the way are that, Verizon does not work on dual-sim phones, and Samsung Pay doesn't work in the U.S. with non-US phones. I ended up having to use Google Pay on my phone instead. The phone has great battery life. Great for multi-tasking and a fantastic display. It's not the cheapest phone but compared to competing flagships its ahead of everyone else in terms of hardware and software features.",

Received it in a Samsung box and while all of the other normal stuff was missing (the stuff that u usually always throw away anyway), the phone was sparingly packed in bubble wrap with only the stuff that matters (charger, charging cable, and headphones). Took the phone or and looked like new! No scratches or other imperfections, anywhere! The only way that I could tell that it was used it that it complained about a Sim card change once I powered it up. Totally great experience and battery life is still more than a day with moderate use (but then again I was using Android Auto, so it was actually charging in the car). I'm totally happy with it and glad that I didn't let my hesitations get the better of me,and went ahead and picked it up! My poor tablets are now being regularly ignored, too! Should've done this ages ago! Face recognizion and top with well, too! Oh,and it arrived early,a as well! Total 5-star experience, f\u00fcr me!",

            "body": "Pros: 1. The screen is ABSOLUTE GORGEOUS, I own Samsung Note 9 and Xs Max, the screen on this Sony is unbeatable. Sony used a newer technology to produce their screen and it is looking fantastic. 2. Doesn't wobble that much on the desk comparing to XZ2. 3. VoLTE is working for T-Mobile (I wan't able to test on other carriers). 4. Comes with Android 9 out of the box. 5. Front facing camera is amazing with much clearer pictures comparing to XZ2, even better than Xs Max. 6. Very sleek design and it has NO NOTCH!! 7. Front facing speakers sounds really good comparing to Note 9. 8. Dedicated camera button instead of a Bixby button. Cons: 1. Fingerprint scanner is still a bit awkwardly placed. 2. Even though it comes with Android 9, the gesture control like on the new Pixel 3 phones is removed. (I personally don't care since the gesture control is really awkward anyway) 3. Even though it packs a 3300mAh battery, I have less battery percentage after a day of use comparing to Xs Max, but it does hold me through a day. (I have 6 hours of screen on time; I watch YouTube videos, play games, and scroll through social media apps like Facebook and Instagram.) 4. Headphone jack is gone forever for flagship phones from Sony (I use their bluetooth headphones and LDAC is great on playing my FLAC files through bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me.) Conclusion: This is really a great phone from Sony. They improved this phone from XZ2 in all of the aspects. Awesome display, great front facing speakers, and great cameras. The battery life is average to good comparing to other flagships in 2018, but it still is able to hold me through a day, so I have so complaints here. Sony is the only company out there still adding a dedicated camera button, and I have to say, I love it. If you are looking out there for a great phone from Sony, this is a really nice option even if it costs $900 (I pre-ordered it with the Ear Duo bundle, but I would still buy it for $900 for phone only).",

            "body": "Being a Vine reviewer puts me in a strange position relative to most phone users. I keep getting offered Sony phones, because I've reviewed them in the past. I have now reviewed the XA1, XZ1, XZ2, and XZ2 Premium. So I have a very fine grained perspective when it comes to the XZ3, and will approach this from the aspect of \"which Sony phone should you choose?\" *Why Sony?* First, I suppose, is the question of \"Why a Sony Phone?\" Well, the answer to my mind is an emphasis on entertainment, with excellent screens and front-facing stereo speakers. Second is camera, with an emphasis on high detail, high-megapixel photos. Third is general build quality - Sony makes beautiful hardware. Now, of course, Apple and Samsung also do these three things pretty well, too. They take differing approaches to camera and A/V quality, but I do think these three companies are within spitting distance of each other. *Sony\u2019s 2018 Lineup* OK, Now, I'm going to compare the three most recent Sony models - the XZ2, XZ2 Premium, and XZ3. I don't know what Sony execs are smoking over there in Tokyo, but they have decided to release these models within 6 months of each other - from April through October 2018, respectively. So new stock is still available for all three. Why they chose to cannibalize themselves this way is beyond me. I can't imagine an XZ2 buyer being very happy with Sony releasing the XZ3 a bit less than 6 months after they plunked down for their current phone. All three phones share Sony's new \"Ambient Flow\" design language. This means they are round, slippery, shiny glass sandwich phones that have reduced bezels compared to their predecessors and a fingerprint sensor in the center of the rear of the phone body. All three share the \"Motion Eye\" camera sensor that excels at 960fps slow motion filming, 4K HDR video, and capturing bursts of moving still shots while staying in focus. All three utilize the Snapdragon 845 system-on-a-chip with Adreno 630 graphics. So they are all very capable 2018 Android flagships. The differences: The XZ2 has 4gb of RAM on board. It has an 18:9 IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080x2160. The XZ2 Premium has 6gb of RAM, a 16:9 4K IPS LCD screen at 3840x2160, and a second monochrome camera module for improved low light performance. The XZ3 kind of splits the difference between the two. It has 4gb of RAM, the same camera module as the XZ2, but upgrades the 18:9 screen to a 6 inch HDR OLED display with a resolution of 1440x1880. Price wise, these models are going for 700, 1000, and 900 respectively at present. So the $200 difference between the XZ2 and XZ3 all comes down to the screen. And I will say, it is an absolutely beautiful screen. The blacks are as close to zero as they eye can see, and the brightness for HDR video is spectacular. It also has the trendy curved side edges that you might like on the Samsung Galaxy line. But otherwise, the XZ3 is functionally identical to the XZ2. It performs the same, gets basically the same 1-day battery life (5-6 hours of screen on time), and takes identical pictures. I would say the price premium is only justified if you really prize the display and watch a lot of high quality video. The XZ2 Premium is a bit of a different beast. It does perform basically identically on Android tasks, given the same internals. The 6gb of RAM seem to be dedicated to the camera, which is the big differentiator. Adding the second low-light module to the camera does improve low light performance over the XZ2 and XZ3. It\u2019s not night and day (so to speak) but the differences are clearly there upon close inspection. There is more detail and less noise on the XZ2 Premium\u2019s low light photos. Its screen is the highest resolution of the bunch, and it performs well with HDR video \u2013 though the XZ3 probably beats it with its deeper native contrast ratio. Now, is this worth a $300 price premium over the XZ2? Personally, I don\u2019t think so. Given the choice of which one to use for free, I\u2019ll take the XZ2 Premium. But if I were doing the math on my own budget, the XZ2 would be extremely tempting. *XZ3 Specific notes* The XZ3 does also add a few new features, almost all of which are superfluous. \u201cSide Sense\u201d brings up a shortcut menu when you double tap the curved edges of the screen. It is prone to misfires, though, so is more of an annoyance than anything. The phone also recognizes when you pull it out of your pocket and orient it in landscape, and pulls up the camera. But since you still have to tap the screen to initiate the camera, it really offers no benefit over the (wonderful) dedicated shutter button. The XZ3 is probably the prettiest of the three phones, and is also the lightest. If you\u2019re into comparing phones with your friends, it is likely the one which will get the most \u201coohs and aahs\u201d next to a Galaxy S9 or iPhone Xs. A case is an absolute necessity, since the phone is so thin, svelte, and slippery. I almost dropped it several times before nestling it into its excellent Ringke Fusion X case. *Conclusion* People who want to buy a Sony phone have been put in a hard spot by\u2026 Sony. It has released three similar flagship phones within 6 months. All three of the phones perform basically identically when it comes to speed. The XZ3 has the best screen. The XZ2 Premium has the best camera. Which of these three areas of performance you value most is how you should make your decision if a Sony phone is in your future. I frankly think the XZ2 will offer the best bang-for-buck for most users. It is also the model that is now best situated to compete with phones like the OnePlus 6T on price. Only those who seriously prioritize display or camera should consider the \u201cstep-up\u201d models, which come at a significant price premium. Photos: 1. XZ2 Premium cat in very low light 2.

            "body": "Pros: The screen is stunning. I'll be watching a lot more videos on this phone than usual. The design is really well thought out and feels very premium and sturdy. It feels like top notch materials were used. A lot of little things have been refined coming from other Xperia devices, such as double tap to wake being added, stamina mode performance is increased so typing isn't an issue, reworked camera app. Cons: The phone is lacking WiFi calling and VoLTE support on the T-mobile network (I'm assuming this is the same for all US carriers). This is a huge let down and really impacts the effectiveness of this device as a cell phone. The screen is so great that I'm going to be wasting a lot of battery watching videos. Oh well. Some of my initial camera shots with medium light came out a little grainy. I'm not sure if this is an isolated issue but it's still less than ideal in a $900 phone. Lack of support in the U. S. in some ways, such as lack of accessories or carrier support. Full review: Starting out with the design, the phone definitely feels great. It's a big phone, yet it still manages to feel elegant in the hand. It's a bit heavy but the weight is distributed evenly so it isn't very apparent. The build quality appears to be very premium and I imagine it will hold up well to time, as most Sony phones I have had tend to last. Almost every review I've heard on this phone has made some mention of the finger print sensor location being too low. I have average sized hands and make contact with the sensor every time. I think I prefer this location over one that is higher up only because I'd rather bend my finger to make contact with the sensor instead of stretching it. This is one of those things that is purely a personal preference and I think reviewers are complaining to complain, what's new. The software is very familiar if you've ever used a Sony/Android phone before, and is easy to learn if you haven't. If you're thinking about switching from an iPhone, Android is quite a liberating experience, and Sony makes it easy to transfer over with the Xperia Companion App. A couple new software features have been added, such as the side sense feature which is similar to the HTC and Pixel phone squeezes, although it may not be entirely as reliable, but I still find it quite useful. I have heard of some users complaining about accidently activating side sense, but I haven't had that issue (either due to how I hold the phone or possibly an update, I'm not sure which)(actually just kidding I see what they're talking about now, if your palms or fingers overlap onto the screen, it picks it up as a tap occasionally). Everything feels very fluid and I doubt it would be any different if Sony did include 6GB of RAM, but hey six is bigger than four and I'm sure it wouldn't hurt the user that much to have more RAM, even with a slightly higher drain on battery. A boost mode would be cool to have if you wanted to utilize all 6 gigs at once, and then have it be off during typical use. The new android 9 pie operating system doesn't seem all that different from 8, but I believe that is a good thing because most software related features seem good how they are right now. Various little tweaks have been made here and there by Sony, and most that I can see are either optional or beneficial to the user. The ability to disable and customize things like side sense and the dynamic vibration are awesome and I'm so glad Sony gives the option for this rather than forcing it upon users. I would appreciate seeing this in a few other places however such as with adaptive charging, like manually setting a wake up time instead of my phone trying (and failing) to automatically predict when I will wake up. Finally night mode was added! My poor crippled eyes can finally experience that comforting warm hue when I'm staying up past my bed time. The battery is as good or better than most other offerings out there today. I am almost always able to squeeze out two days of usage from my Sony phones without recharging, and I'd consider myself a medium to heavy user but I do actively try to save battery by reducing brightness, closing apps and turning on stamina mode when needed. Stamina mode is great and ultra stamina mode is great for Bear Grylls. Unfortunately there isn't a fast charger included in the box, just a regular charger. I usually recharge overnight anyway but it is kind of a bummer that I don't feel like a super elite first class dude with the best stuff after spending near a grand on a phone. Battery Care is a nice feature from Sony in a world where most other phone companies are treating their lithium ion filled phablets like a disposable Kodak camera. Next up is the screen. My previous phone was the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, which I thought had an amazing display, and it did, but this phone kicked that up a couple notches. When I started watching videos on this phone with maxed out resolution it felt like the first time I saw a 4K TV on display at Best Buy. I feel really lame admitting this but I got goosebumps. Whatever it could have been cold in my house I'm not sure. It is great to look at though, seeing the screen in person is the only way that you will experience the perfection of this screen. Colors look excellent to me, everything just pops in a realistic way. Nothing really seems washed out or overexposed. Sony did a fantastic job calibrating this. I haven't used a Note 9 or iPhone XS yet so I can't comment on which one is better but I'd feel confident in saying Samsung and Apple have some very tough competition. One thing I will say about the screen is that it looks slightly blue on the curved sections, but this doesn't necessarily apply when watching videos, only when viewing a white screen, so it's not a huge complaint from me as it isn't intrusive or distracting. Sound. Wow this phone kicks! After unboxing the phone I turned up the volume all the way and started watching a video and it was actually loud! Surprisingly, I turned it down. I was surprised again later in the day when I was using the phone for GPS and the speakers were able to surpass the road noise from driving on the highway which I don't think I've ever experienced in a phone before. The Dynamic Vibration System is an interesting experience, and I think with a little bit of tweaking and reduction of latency, Sony might have something cool on their hands. I'd find myself sort of missing it when I turned it off, because in the lowest setting it feels like it adds bass to the phone, even if it doesn't in reality. The subtle sound based vibration isn't going to radically alter your media consumption but hey at least Sony is trying new stuff! Obviously this phone is missing the auxiliary port which to some aux snobs is probably a turn off. The only time I use my aux is when I'm in the car and feeling auxy but even then that isn't very often so this just comes down to personal preference. I think dongles are lame but hey whatever it doesn't really apply to me so I can't tell you how it should apply to yourself. The camera is kind of the typical bag of Sony goodies. You have the super slowmo 960 FPS at 1080p I believe and the 4k HDR video recording. What they offer is on par with most other high end phones. I haven't extensively tested the camera so I don't want to jump to any conclusions. What I do know is that Sony hasnt reinvented the smartphone camera here yet. You still get very good shots that are quite situational. In good light with a steady hand your shots will look good. With hands as shaky as the Dynamic Vibration system on this phone and a night darker than the perfect blacks on this phone's OLED screen, your picture is going to look like some soup. I'll probably come back and update this part of the review once I go outside and experience nature in more than one light setting. Some of my other thoughts on this phone include other bits about the Sony ecosystem and the actual experience of living with the phone. Sony phones have always held up well to time in my experience, more so than any other phone brands I've tried, including Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG and even Pixel phones. I have the same high expectations for this phone. I enjoy the apps Sony has preloaded, such as the album app and music app. It actually gives you an option upon the very first startup on whether you want to install certain other apps (or bloatware depending on who you are) which is pretty cool! I installed most of them because it was stuff like the Playstation app and Amazon that I'm going to use anyway. I really wish Sony would do more with this phone in terms of Playstation compatability. You do have the option of PS4 remote play, which works good with a great internet connection, but I believe there is so much more innovation and opportunity waiting to happen between the Playstation and Sony Mobile teams! Okay now to the part of living with this phone and probably the biggest criticism from me. I have a sneaking suspicion that the whole country known as the United States of America is like a red-headed step child to Sony Mobile. In this metaphor they provide us with a roof over our heads and some food, but not much else. In the US it is highly unlikely that you will find XZ3 cases or screen protectors in your local electronic store, and your cell phone provider will most likely look at you like a fool when you let them know that Sony does indeed make phones. Have fun importing the official Sony style cases to the US if you want them, or maybe even the cool wireless charging stand that is sold in currencies that don't have a $ before them. I really really want this phone to be my perfect phone but it doesn't support Wi-Fi calling. This is a huge miscalculation by whoever made the decision, be it T-mobile or Sony or some higher diety. If you have set foot inside the US then you most likely know it's the land of the free and home of the sprawling empty area outside of cities that has little to no cell reception. I have literally had better reception in rural Thailand than in the middle of the second biggest city in my state, so WiFi calling should be as necessary to phones in 2018 as a fingerprint sensor (I would gladly give up the sensor for Wi-Fi calling BTW). This being said, if you need a phone that can be a means of communication above all else, I do not believe the XZ3 is for you. It really pains me to say that because this phone does so many things right, but the one area it lacks in is the main thing phones are used for, communication. That being said, cell reception is good and I haven't noticed anything wonky in the areas I normally get reception. To summarize my points, this is an excellent phone, but there are quite a few other excellent phones out there. This is one of the few phones that is hard to complain about if you're an average (or anything other than average) phone user. If you like Sony phones, or well designed tech, you're going to love this phone. If you have an issue with losing out on Wi-Fi calling or VoLTE, you should probably skip this phone. If you want an awesomely solid piece of technology in every other way and are willing to look past the few flaws this phone has, then by all means get it, and you won't be disappointed.",

            "body": "It comes with a 3.5mm usb-c dongle. I purchased this phone to replace my old Nexus 5. I selected this smartphone because of its beautiful screen. Watching high quality videos on this smart phone will immerse you completely in the video. However outside of video watching, the phone needs to be calibrated to suit you: I turned off side sense because it is a feature that I don't need. I had to enable the zoom in feature because it was disabled I had to enable moving apps from the app storage sceen to the main screen I had to disable the always on screen feature Enabling to auto rotate on the home screen seems to make the phone rotate from portrait to landscape a lot quicker The camera on the phone works better in Manual mode vesus Auto I think I will turn on the glove mode because sometimes the screen doesnt recognize my taps I the phone will automatically close unused/idle apps I am happy with this phone because of its beautiful screen! There are other features on the phone that I haven't tried and will try them out as the situation dictates. Also, this phone is super fast! The Xperia Duo is great for listening to music when you want to be aware of your surroundings. Voice chat on the Xperia duo was horrible, the sound quality was horrible and It wouldn't stay connected for long phone calls The control features of the Xperia Duo such as swipping or head nodding is not responsive The battery on the Xperia Duo drains fast but charging is very fast. The right ear piece will always run out of power first.",

            "body": "The Sony Xperia XZ3 is really an amazing Cell Phone. My only complaint is with Sony, why, because the Xperia XZ3 Lens is constructed using Gorilla Temper Glass 5. Well, my phone had fallen out of my shirt pocket when bent over which was about waist high, needless to say, the lens cracked. I called Sony told them of the situation and their response was, they would repair the lens for $250.00 plus shipping. Now, to my understanding Gorilla Temper Glass 5 has a drop ratio from shoulder high. My phone was and still in a case designed specifically for the Xperia XZ3 and the glass still cracked. So, if you carry your phone in your top pocket, beware - because if it does fall and the lens crack Sony is the only one in the position to change the lens out. No company here in the US will repair or replace the Sony Xperia XZ3.",

            "body": "I enjoy the OLED screen. Edge sense is an interesting function I am playing with where app icons pop up when you touch the edge of the screen. This supports band 12 and VoLTE on T-Mobile which is not common on Xperia. I preferred the fingerprint scanner on the side, on the back is a little awkward. Qi charging is nice, make sure to get a case that will not interfere. I chose this over the XZ2 premium mainly due to the band 12 with VoLTE on Tmobile and the OLED which the XZ2 Premium does not have but I was tempted by the XZ2 Premium dual camera. As is typical of glass body the phone is a little slippery so a case would be a good idea. I got it with the Xperia Ear Duo which I enjoy but it is not for everyone. The duo on purpose lets one hear sound around you which is great for biking or walking etc. but would not block out any noise on a train, a plane or any other environment with a lot of noise. I found the sound a little bit low in some cases. The assistant is interesting, I enjoy it but it is not for everyone. The battery of the ear duo lasts nearly 4 hours but the case has a battery that can recharge the ear duo.",

The location of the finger print sensor isn't an issue at all for me. I just hold the phone from the bottom and the sensor is right where my finger lands. The image quality of the camera to me is just average. I know there are many adjustments and I'm sure I could tweak it to be great. Just that comparing it to my S8 right out of the box isn't too impressive. I also miss the time lapse option. Great phone altogether though, premium materials and build quality, the green and red versions are STUNNING! Absolutely a contender.",

I have had Sony phones for the last 15 years, and this one is by far the most boring, none of those cool features I love, message wallpaper, color coding people, etc... and way too much Google crap! other than it being kinda plain it's ok. I am disappointed tho.",

I just got this phone and I'm so glad I did. The green one is really nice. It feels premium in your hand and it's easy to hold. Here are some of the things I love about this phone. -The screen is AMAZING. -The OS is so easy to navigate. It's the simplest Android you will find out there -The phone itself is very fast -Fingerprint is at the back which some have to get use to, but it's very fast and accurate to turn on the phone. -The camera takes great pictures -The sound quality of the music you play is rich and please to your ears I have always use Sony phone despite of whatever anyone say. Quality is quality. They don't make product that will blow up on the plane (Samsung) or recently recall one of their product (also Samsung). You can't beat a Japanese when it comes to technology. I would highly recommended this phone.",

            "body": "Let me say up front that we're an Xperia family - I just moved from the XZ1 to the XZ3, and my daughter just went from the XZ Compact to the XZ Compact 2. So it hurts me a little to say it, but I don't like the XZ3 nearly as much as the XZ1. What's good: - The quality is flagship worthy. The screen is beautiful, the cameras are great, and I assume it's at least as waterproof as my XZ1 was. (And my XZ1 spent 4 hours 15 feet down in the ocean and started working as soon as we found it and brought it back up!) - The battery is pretty good, and even for a heavy user like me, lasts a full day as long as I'm not running Waze. What could be better - As beautiful as the phone is, there is no way to use it without a case. It has curved sides and a glass back, and I just guarantee it will slip sooner or later. - Instead of the nice wide buttons of the XZ1, the XZ3 has super skinny buttons (apparently made to fit the curved sides) that are much harder to press, especially if the phone is in a case, which, as stated, its design basically requires. As much as I love having a dedicated camera button, I feel like I need to press it with my fingernail to reliably hit it, which removes a lot of the convenience. (It can also be hard to hit the volume button correctly, and I've already accidentally turned on assisted mode twice!) - I really liked having a fingerprint scanner in the power button. I'm learning to use the one on the back, but it's sort of begging for me to miss and get my greasy fingers all over the nearby camera lens. Overall, it's a beautiful and powerful phone, but the design choices ultimately make it less functional than my old XZ1.",

Android platform is well laid out, as well as the Sony layout in general. This is my first experience with a Sony phone, so I wasnt sure what to expect. It's very easy to use and to get used to. Everything just makes sense. Its easy to find what you want and do what you want. If you use your phone for heavy entertainment purposes - movies, pics, videos, music.. - this is the phone to get. It's an entertainment work horse with plenty of ram, too.",

Let me start with the fingerprint scanner, it is in a perfect place for me. I don't have huge hands and due to the length, I'm not stretching my finger around to find the scanner, I have never accidentally hovered over the camera. One on the other things I love is the camera system. How many phones come with a dedicated camera button? This was a feature I missed on my previous phone. The camera itself is located in such a great position. I've haven't accidentally taken a picture of my finger when holding it in landscape mode. The system is snappy and fluid. The screen looks awesome. I just wish manufactures would bring back the headphone jack. This was a bundle purchase with the xperia duo headset. At first they were awkward to put on but after a few tries you get used to them quickly. They don't seal into the ear like my other headset which is nice. They sound amazing. Overall this is a great phone and headset. I really love this phone, I'm glad I didn't listen to all of the negative reviews.",

            "body": "Summary: This is a prestige style option that feels unparalleled in the hand and sports an industry-leading screen - if that is what is important to you, this is the phone of your dreams, and the few minor complaints will be entirely acceptable. Pros: * Gorgeous design. The Forest Green color is incredibly attractive and gives handsome variation in tone in different lighting. While Sony has moved into a curved world, the monolithic lines of the profile (including the very narrow corners) remain and remind me of what I loved about the Z1 Compact. The 2:1 aspect ratio makes this phone more slender than most. The glossy black finish of the front with the curved edges is really something else. This is what sold me and I have not been disappointed. * Excellent materials. The contour of the glass is incredibly pleasing in the hand, as is the thin aluminum frame. While some have different opinions on glass backs, the full glass coverage mitigates some of the slipperiness of the phone's curved edges by providing grip - something I missed with the magnesium back of the Pixel. The design may have sold me, but the feel of the phone in the hand is what's confirming the decision. * OLED screen. Fantastic quality, insane DPI, it's very clear this is the same tech Sony uses in its Bravia screens. I wouldn't have come back to Sony without this. * Great camera. Works well in many different lighting scenarios. * Snappy processor. I haven't noticed any slowdown and new games/apps work perfectly well. I'm not a huge gamer though so other reviews might cover this better than I will. * Fingerprint scanner. For many, the low rear placement has been a con. For those of us with smaller hands, it's a godsend, plain and simple. * Dedicated camera button. I missed you! * No notch. If you like notches, flip this to the con category! Neutral * Picks up fingerprints easily. On the other hand, they wipe off easily. Since it's so gorgeous when wiped clean, hard to call this a big winner or loser. Cons * Slippery. Will slide off of angled surfaces. This is mitigated in the hand by the glass. So while I feel secure not putting this phone in a case, I need to be cognizant of where I put it down. * No headphone jack. This was a hard reality for me to come to, but when I'm out and about I'm using bluetooth and when I'm home I can plug in the USB-C to use my fancy headphones. * Weak battery - I make it through the day with email, news, a few minutes of fire emblem/youtube, but not by much. * Expensive. Sony seems to be pricing to make up for weak sales in the US. Maybe they got a few more bucks from me, but I'm not convinced it's a winning strategy.",

However my worst experience ever was when this phone got into major system crash just a week after the purchase. Technical support failed to resolve the issue while on the phone for over 40 minutes that I had to ship to their Service center. Now it has been 3 weeks and I am still waiting to get back my phone!",

            "body": "All I can is wow!! This is my first Sony phone and I absolutely love it. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone before. I'm coming from a LG V30 and with that device, I felt like I could never get the screen comfortable enough for my eyes. It was either too bright or too dark.. But with this OLED screen everything is bright, punchy, and clear right out of the box! Now I'll admit the lack of headphone jack put me off at first, however it comes with adapter in the box which is great and very helpful. I'll say this though be prepared to update multiple times. I believe I restarted and went through 5 or 6 Xperia updates before I was up to calendar. However if you love Sony like I do, would like a phone with a beautiful screen that's great for traveling and watching Netflix on.. Then get this! I couldn't be happier with it!",

            "body": "Less than 3 months after receiving this phone it is crashing. Data turning on and off, rebooting itself...tried resetting internet connections, new SIM card, and finally did a factory reset. Nothing worked, the hardware itself was bad. After spending 3-4 days with Sony tech people telling me to do troubleshooting I had already done, I finally get told to email them all my info including IMEI and they will send a return authorization for repair. Not even a replacement phone, a repair. I emailed the requested info. Received nothing for several more days. Called in because the chat feature (which supposedly is open 9-8pm) never works, and no one responds to emails (I emailed multiple times). I was told I would receive the return authorization within the next day; auto email followup said within 48 hours. Three days later, still nothing. I had to call in again, and the guy said I would receive it within 3 hours. Still nothing. Next day, I call in again. This time I get angry, and another guy actually sends me the Fedex shipping label within an hour. So now I go to Fedex where I have to pay for my own box, and discover they only have shipping loss coverage for up to $100; the form says I can add extra to that, but Fedex says \"no, that would have to be applied at the time the shipping label was created.\" So apparently if my new $600 phone gets lost or damaged in the mail, I'll just be out $500. And the real kicker is that I probably won't have it back for two weeks. While the phone itself is lovely (beautiful screen) and it has good sound quality, I would advise people to steer clear of it. The camera is good as well, but really only for close-ups. The zoom is not good. Not at all worth the hassle and weeks without use of a new phone. Update: I sent my device off to Sony for repair, and they sent it back in exactly the same condition. It doesn't work. They refuse to replace the phone. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they hung up on me.",

            "body": "I've had a good number of Sony Xperia Phones: - Sony Ericsson, Xperia ZL, Xperia Z3, Xperia XZ (most recent) The Xperia XZ3 is a better replacement for my Xperia XZ. For comparison basis, I'll be referring to my previous phone the Xperia XZ. Battery Life: With a single charge at 11pm, I immediately unplugged the device. I started to use the phone starting at 6am. I was able to use the XZ3 nearly all day and still have at least 55% by midnight. -I've streamed music for at least 8 hours -Connected my bluetooth headset -at least 3 to 4 hours of screen time (emails, texting, web search, and netflix) by 8pm I was at 60% charge. It's close to midnight now and it the phone is still at 49% charge. Battery Stamina is set to kick in at 45%. If I didn't charge this phone tonight, It will likely last till 12pm. In short you can expect at least 1 day and 12 hours from a single charge with normal usage. Picture Quality: The quality is on par if not better than the Xperia XZ. Even though it was a step down in Camera Spec, the image stabilization, and software processing makes up for the gap in quality. Sound Hands down the best out of any Xperia phone. It may rival the bigger flag ships in terms of quality and clarity. Connectivity: For ATT Network customers, this phone is LTE Compatible! You will receive and achieve full LTE speeds offered by ATT. This was one of my biggest fear was being stuck with H+ instead of LTE. -Phone call clarity is much better. The reception on is much clearer to the receiver and you will be able to hear better as well. Side note: if you buy this phone now 6/2019, you will have to update your phone. There are at least 7 major updates to the OS. That's a good thing but it takes some time. So be patient it is well worth the wait. Forgot to mention: The FINGER PRINT SENSOR WORKS in the US Model of the phone! FINALLY!!!! Major improvements. This is definitely the phone to get. Hold off from getting the Xperia 1 as it will be a battery drain on that larger 4k display.",

I have owned Sony phones in the past, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Asus, iPhone, & LG. The XZ3 surpasses all of them. I will never use any other brand of phone besides Sony from now on. The screen quality is top notch, the camera is really great. One of my friends that just got the iphone x is amazed and how much better the Sony camera is compared to his iphone. The phone is very fluid and snappy and the battery lasts me on an average work day with moderate use from 6am until 10pm with about 20-30% battery remaining. The fact that it vibrates to music is a little strange and can fortunately be turned off. The fingerprint sensor is extremely fast to react. Really everything about this phone is positive with the exception of the missing headphone port.",

I am an audio freak that loves music, the combo with the Duo ear phones is a must. I can hear every little sound and still have a conversation with those around me. The battery is the only poor part of the phone. I have the XZ 1 and that battery lasts 22hrs or so, 18 when power using, this phone seems to only last 12-13hrs when I am power using it, but with this brilliant screen you would expect the Power to drain. They may come out with an update like they did with the other models. All and all, don't hesitate looking at other phones this is the best on the market!",

            "body": "You will be impressed with the awesome screen on this phone. And the sound is quite impressive as well. The fingerprint scanner works more reliably than what I've had on other phones, e.g. when my fingers are a little wet. Overall the quality of pretty much every detail is high. The performance of the camera in low light surprised me. I went into a room dark enough that I would definitely want to turn on the light (overcast day with blinds closed) and took a picture. It used a long exposure, and the resulting photo looks like I took it on a normal day. This was without a tripod; I was just holding the camera (still) in my hands, so I'm assuming that image stabilization helped out. I'm used to quite the opposite, that in low light photos are far worse than what I see with my eyes. Also, someone complained about the lack of WiFi calling. If you have Google Voice, you can make calls over WiFi on this phone -- it works great. And if you don't already know about Google Voice, you're missing out; get it and enjoy WiFi calling. I see tons of complaints about the fingerprint scanner being too low, but I think I know why they put it where they did, and it makes sense to me. On my old phone the scanner was higher, close to the camera, and the camera *always* had fingerprints on it. On this phone, the scanner is right in the center, so if you register your fingerprints from the side you can easily find the scanner and spare the camera. You'll only be unhappy with the placement of the scanner if you insist on coming at it from the bottom. The curved back has plusses and minuses. On the plus side, it feels really good in the hand, because you are not holding the phone just by the edges -- more of the back surface makes contact with your hand. That also makes it less likely to slip out of your hand. However, what is good for your hand is bad for everything else -- when you put the phone on a flat surface, it is resting on just a point. I have had the phone slide off of a surface that I thought was flat and hit the floor. I took that as a warning, so now a phone case is on the way. I'm still on the fence about Sony's \"Side-Sense\" feature. It's handy when it works, but I seem to have trouble invoking it when I want it, and too often it comes up when I didn't mean for it to. I'm giving it a few weeks to decide whether I should just disable it. One of my favorite things about the camera is that it is water-resistant. The last phone I bought began a slow decline after I got caught by surprise with some rain. I immediately put the camera (which was in a silicone case) in my pocket, but my pants got damp. The video on the phone started acting weird the next day, and over the next month or so it eventually gave out, rendering the phone useless. With the XZ3 I won't have to worry about that kind of thing -- there's an AndroidPit video on YouTube in which a guy runs an XZ3 (that is capturing video) through a dishwasher cycle. Overall an awesome phone. You'll love the gorgeous display.",

            "body": "This is a high end Android phone from Sony. Sony does not have a lot of phone distribution in the US, and it's too bad given that this Xperia phone is very, very nice. I would say it is a nicer piece of hardware than my son's iPhone X. Some of the things I liked: 1. Very nicely finished. The craftsmanship is on par with anything out there. 2. Wrap around screen with edge sense short cuts - much like Samsung high end phones. 3. Really fast processor. I still like my iPhones, but this thing feels twice as zippy. 4. Fingerprint sensor on the back side. Good idea. 5. No crashes, no hassles getting it going. 6. Fast boot from cold start. 7. Multi day battery life - about 2x the life of my iPhone. 8. USB C connector - enter the modern age. 9. Sharp camera, but needs some post production color correction, IMO. 10. Awesomely good looking screen. I shot a photo of the screen and posted it to show how the screen is a \"retina-like\" imaging device. Maybe better. Middling issues. 1. The camera is nice, but I don't think the color balance is as good as on my iPhone. The Xperia colors are too vivid and the iPhone is more natural to my eyes. 2. Uh, it's Android and that means you have a certain amount of arranging to do before it becomes super useful. I've never liked Android as much as iOS. I can use it, but then again I've used RT-11, VMS, DOS and Unix 4.x BSD ... I don't value the total control aspect as much as others do. I just want to get going and the \"total customization\"opportunity of Android, I find t be an obligation. Not the phone's fault, though. Cons 1. None significant. Summary I've looked at my friends' Android phones, but this one makes theirs look like toys. If you can afford it and want an Android, this could be your choice.",

Able to see in bright sunlight environment. A bit longer than any phone I\u2019ve ever had and that seems to make it fit better in my hands. Front camera is a single 19 MP, f/2.0, 25mm camera. I\u2019ve had great results in all lighting conditions with the front camera. More contrast and HDR look to images than other phones I\u2019ve used. Great for 4K video as well. Selfie camera is single 13 MP, f/1.9, 23mm camera. Works well in most lighting conditions. Finger print scanner on the back works fast and is in a good location for my hands. Also come with multi touch screen. Build quality is excellent. Feels like quality in your hand. Comes with lastedAndroid OS Pie Speakers are the best I\u2019ve heard on any mobile device. Even ones 10 times the size. Also has the vibration sound assist which is a brilliant idea and makes the sound that much better. Comes with non-removable Li-Ion 3300 mAh battery that lasts for a long time. Easily last me the day with light to moderate use. Cons No audio jack. A trend among all manufacturers these day. I think portrait mode suffers from not having 2 front cameras. Portraits I have seen on other flagship phones are better. Side sense is annoying but easy to turn off.",

The screen is beautiful for a phone- it really does take the whole \"phone\" thing to an entirely new level. I will admit that we are mostly iPhone people in day-to-day use, but phones like this make me consider switching all of us over simply because the clarity of the screen and the camera is beyond what is available to us in the Apple range. Sony, as always, really does knock it out of the park with their displays, whether it's TVs or devices. I'm truly impressed with this one.",

As a phone, it works just like you'd expect. The sound and battery life is pretty standard. Unfortunately, it's single-SIM, but other models do support dual-SIM.

            "body": "Do not order a regular US case for the Moto e5 Play if you have the international version of this phone - the international version is a little smaller that the US version and will fall out of the US made cases. Instead look for a case that specifically states it is for the XL1920 version. The only ones I have found come from China and take a month or more to arrive. For example, a case by QiongNi is currently being sold on Amazon that fits the international phone (search for QiongNi Case for Motorola Moto E5 Play Go XT1920-15 XT1920-16 XT1920-18 XT1920-19). I wish the seller of the Moto e5 Play phone would provide this information in its Amazon listing. I ordered two cases from Amazon that didn't fit the international phone and had to return them. I then discovered the size difference by doing Google searches. Apart from the case issue, the phone works well for its intended use (bought for family overseas) and is very good quality for an affordable price.",

            "body": "My previous Motorola phone sustained a screen crack in a drop, and I was unable to text anything. It was also impossible to clone the old phone with this new phone, but the cloud backup was flawless in bringing the new phone on line. The back is pressed plastic, used a guitar pick, slid the battery into place, swapped the nano sim card into the slot, and with WiFi connected, everything was normal again within 2 hours. The turbo charger is incredibly fast. Battery life is acceptable. The phone is plastic, very light, 5.7\" overall and just what I needed. Great price for the features. Phone works only on GSM, not CDMA, so know your carrier before ordering. The finger print sensor is fantastic for picking up the phone one handed and getting the screen to open. I use a password, but hate the steps to enter it every time, but the finger sensor below the camera, disguised as the logo, is perfect as a way to bypass that. Others can use the phone if you give the password. Great for keeping the little ones off your phone. It is true about the 1GB vice 2 GB (go to Settings/system/about phone/hardware information). 16 GB of storage. Like the ability to buy another battery swap when needed by just opening the back and dropping the new one in. The cameras are excellent, front and back. Speakers are front facing. Everything a light phone user like me could want. Update: Have had the phone for a while now and still like everything about it. Protip: Perform a fingerprint, as another user, for your other hand so you can pick the phone up with either hand and get instant access.",

            "body": "The phone lacks a tremendous amount when it comes to taking pictures. Most are \"foggy\". No where near the clarity I had with my other Motorola. Also, finding a case for it is impossible. Even when ordering a case (and I ordered three) that is suppose to fit the E5 Play, it does not fit. Found one that was close and my husband adds some foam pieces to help it stay in place. The price was right, but now, knowing what I give up when taking pictures of my grandkids, I would have gladly paid more to get a better camera and case. To date, have been unable to get a screen saver that fits. I ordered a case and screen saver from Amazon, and the screen saver was no where near a match for the phone. Disappointing!",

If you are looking for a phone to be your sole camera this isn't it, but it does great for record keeping and such. Other reviews have mentioned the difficulty in finding a case for this phone. Because this is the international version of the phone the dimensions are different from the American model. I did find a case that fit well, but it was for the E5 Play GO. So if you want a case, search for that. A regular off the shelf E5 Play will not fit this phone. Over all I have been very happy with this purchase!",

Family Mobile - Walmart -(GSM), Sells this phone in store, and doesn't work on their service either. Boost Mobile (CDMA), Of course not, wrong band... 0/4 on service activation with USA based Carriers, and most of the others have too expensive of plans that would negate the value of this device for a cheap phone over time. The phone build and construction is servicable, it isn't fast or amazing, but it's decent and cheap, just tragic the phone will not work on any of the carriers I tried, even 2 that support the Band and list the device as compatible, which it wasn't.",

            "body": "I purchased this Motorola model from Walmart because my Samsung Galaxy S8 got smashed and was out of commission in repair for a week and a half. The version I purchased was set up on Verizon's pre-paid service and cost $59 out of pocket. I paid the required $50 to set up a month of \"pre-paid\" service in order to use the phone on my existing account, so the total cost was $109 plus tax. After using the phone for a week, I do not understand why I, or anyone else, pay $900+ for iPhones, S-whatevers, or other expensive mobile phone models. This phone is completely functional, runs the Android operating system like any other phone, and has all the features you would expect. Yes, the camera has crummy resolution and the touch screen isn't silky smooth like your iPhone. It doesn't have the flashy bonus features or ultra high resolution of your Samsung Galaxy phone. Perhaps navigating some of the settings isn't as easy. However, this phone runs all the required software, takes workable photos, connects to the 4G network just fine, connects to Bluetooth devices, and does any other FUNCTIONAL task you might need on a day to day basis. The main difference is that this Motorola Moto E5 Play phone is 1/10 the cost of the most recent iPhone or Galaxy smartphone. For these reasons, the phone deserves five stars just based purely on the value. I recommend considering this phone over top brands for anyone where cost is a concern.",

THIS PHONE is the international version. The standard version has full Android Oreo 8.0. THIS PHONE has a stripped-down GO version of Oreo. The display is not as crisp, and colors appear washed out (to use less memory). The standard version fits the cases sold on Amazon for the e5 Play.

The standard version DOES NOT HAVE a fingerprint reader. THIS PHONE DOES. This is not a bad phone, but it's different from the standard version in more ways than just having a dual SIM. Pay attention to the model number on the box - the standard version is XT1921-3. THIS PHONE is XT1920 -19.

            "body": "Likes: Multi screen Great volume Easy to use Fast speed Plenty of memory Great for somebody with low budget (bought at Best Buy for $69.00) Great options for setting up the phone security Clear crisp appearing screen Dislikes: Setup was difficult. I didn't have a mobile number (at the time) that I could use. I tried using the WI FI on my old phone to activate new one but didn't know how to activate the new phone while using the old one which was unlocked. So had to go somewhere to borrow a phone to call to Activate the phone. The 20 count number that was necessary to provide was ridiculously small. I was barely able to decipher it and missed a number when I was writing it down on a sheet of paper to make my life easier. I had to get an agent to help me and shortly after give the new provider the PIN and account number of my previous carrier to get authorization to keep my cell number. Took hours instead of minutes to get 1/2 things accomplished that should have taken under a half hour. Having a WI FI connection is vital or you can't do any of this. The feature that is supposed to detect you are looking at the screen must require a insane amount of light or it'll tell you it can't detect you and to please find better lighting. Sounded nice but having a timer on the device to shut itself off after so many minutes would have been nice and I don't know or think I have that option. I can't think of anything else other than to say that the instructions to create a split screen should be more specific. You have to hold before you can slide but you have to give it a few seconds before you attempt to slide or it'll be obstinate!",

When I bought it I trusted the description that states that this phone has 2GB, also as there is no mention of the battery capacity I was expecting it to be as described in the specs you can find on the internet, which is 2800 mAh. I really liked the phone, but I was not happy after realizing this mismatch, as I could not afford the time to return it and get a different one elsewhere, the seller took responsibility and we reached an agreement for the inconvenience. I suggested updating the description to make it accurate, so no one else needed to go through a similar situation, then I waited sometime before writing my reviews regarding the purchase and the product, but as of today 12/12/2018, the description is still the same. I recommend this phone, even though is below my expectations regarding specs. Compared to my old Moto X, it runs flawless, and the newest version of Android knows how to save space. The fingerprint reader works great, the camera, etc, all the functionalities are working perfectly. It is truly unlocked and works in the frequency bands I needed. It is still too young to talk about its battery life, so I might update this review later in time.",

I'm on my third ordered case, with no luck yet finding one that will fit. As others have noted, the RAM is only 1gb. There are features on this phone that I like, but I've decided I have to return the phone. The false item details in the description, such as the overstated RAM are bad enough, but the lack of a case for protection and insufficient battery with no backup simply make the phone unreliable. Really disappointing. I got this phone to replace my E4 that has gotten a cracked screen. This model of E5 is something entirely different; even different from the 'E5 Play' that the description says it is. Read the reviews; not the item description.",

Even the one thing about it that was decent - the 8MP camera - would randomly split a new photo shot into 2 low quality pics, and apply seemingly random automatic filters by the drastic difference in lighting and tone from one shot to the next. This phone is anti-consumer quality control incarnate and designed to be a waste of money - there are WAY better and cheaper phones, especially older models.

I contacted Samsung and Amazon, and since this is an unlocked phone purchased from a second party (Mobile Connections) I could not process the repair through either of them. I contacted Mobile Connections telling them what what Samsung told me and they said they would not help. They told me to contact Samsung yet another time, who confirmed what they said earlier. The thing to keep in mind is if you buy an unlocked phone from Mobile Connections you have NO WARRANTY. No one will repair it and Mobile Connections will not help you. It's important to add when they originally sold this item to me the title was \"Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920i Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black Sapphire.\" The recently added \"no warranty\" to the title because of my interaction with them, all the while not telling me they had a change of policy and that they just decided to not honor warranties in anyway. Moral of the story, don't trust Mobile Connections.",

Also its a Droids version of an I phone, no external memory (You can't add a chip IOT save songs or more pictures...). You only have the cloud for memory, if you're in a location that limits connectivity you don't have access to your stored music, files, pictures... I like being able to add 90Gigs of memory to my S5. The S6 also has a sealed battery compartment (Like the I phone) so you can't change the battery or carry extra batteries for long camping trips... You also have to keep a special pin on hand to eject or change you SIM card. That's very inconvenient during international travel and your changing SIM's. You get a better bang for your buck when you buy the S5. Hopefully the S7 will bring back external memory... So I have both the S5 and S6 but won't be changing to the S6. I may sell it of give it to my kid who doesn't need the memory or dual SIMs for travel.",

            "body": "I bought this s6 from SurgeTelecom on amazon and at first it seemed fine. but then i noticed the battery life was not so good. it would die about halfway through the day. Then the screen became very unresponsive. About 3 out of 4 times touching the screen had no effect at all. i returned it and bought an s6 sold by amazon with neither problem so far. This may be my imagination but after getting my second s6 i feel like the first one was lighter than the second one. After reading other reviews i'm starting to think this seller either sells refurbished or knock off phones.",

I keep all my meetings and POC and locations of them on my phone so when it started acting like that, it made my daily schedule very difficult to tract and manage sometimes. i need it change.",

I need wifi calling because I have poor signal in my home. But the phone only has that feature on it if it is bought from a carrier. The phone itself is amazing, I highly recommend the Galaxy.

Fingerprint scanner is not quite as quick as the iPhone. Only real qualms with it are that it cannot be registered if you own it in Canada or the US. If there is a way, I have not found it despite hours of trying and calling customer services in Canada and the US. Samsung offices are not connected country to country. The only other thing is there is quite a bit of pre-installed bloatware that cannot be uninstalled. Otherwise a good phone and passes any real check I've done to be a real S6.",

            "body": "I only owned the phone for a few days, and I like it very much so far. The screen is awesome, very bright and sharp. It makes great pictures, although I was surprised to find out that you do not need to unlock the phone to take pictures. I see possibility of pranks and unauthorized picture taking. The phone works so fast compared to my old not so smart smartphone, it is amazing how things are changing. The phone is lightweight, charges fast, and the battery last for quite long time. I signed up for MetroPCS, my main complaint is that I had to go the store to activate the phone. They would not accept the phone online (they only list ancient phones in their bring your own page, probably to discourage people from buying phones from other places). Do not buy sim card from the store - online and at Walmart it is $10, the MetroPCS guy wanted $25 for the card. Update: I got second S6 phone (White) for a family member, and activated it with Ting service, it was very easy, I needed to order a GSM SIM card from them, and it takes a few days to arrive. You activate the phone with the SIM card then, not with the phone itself. I am thinking about switching my own service to Ting, too.",

When I called the Samsung (US) customer service they were unable to validate the IEMI, Serial or Model numbers. I contacted the seller and he quickly responded telling me that the phone was an \"International Phone\" and he could sell me a warranty insurance for $60. I loved the phone but I am not willing to accept something which was misrepresented in the ad. There was nothing in the product description to indicate the phone was \"International\" and as such carried no US warranty. I have returned the phone and purchased another Samsung Galaxy 6 (with US warranty included) from Best Buy now on sale for $499.",

I tried to charge it with the original charger and nothing happen, the phone got super hot after the first 5 minutes and it never showed me it was charging at all, not even the red light was turned on. Then I submitted a question on Amazon to see what could I be doing wrong and received an answer telling me that I should leave the phone charging more time and I did and again didn't work at all. Then I looked at the package of the phone and saw everything was in Spanish, so it didn't gave me a good feeling (maybe fake phones, I don't know, I'm not an expert) so I decided not to open the second phone. I just return them the next day, it was a very bad experience after spending $1,100 dollars. The \"good part\" of this story is that I received my money back 7 days later, so, good experience here. I ended buying the phone from my mobile phone company, and the package was slightly different in terms of quality and design (it shouldn't be). So, be careful guys.",

            "body": "The seemingly undamaged Galaxy S6 on the left is former; the iPhone 4S on the right is the latter. After having the S6 for 7 months, when the manufacturer's warranty was still active, the phone's screen started turning colors when plugged into my computer, and, over the course of a couple of hours, stopped working. (I had struggled to turn it on once before but thought it was a battery problem, which didn't seem to be the case when I got it on and there was still lots of battery life.) \"Have you ever dealt with Samsung?\" someone asked as I mentioned that I'd have to send in my phone for repairs. I had kept the phone in a $50 waterproof case and been careful with it, since I had previously endured the embarrassment of a cracked iPhone screen for over a year. Yet, after I sent it to in, Samsung claimed the phone wouldn't turn on due to damage to the LCD \"beneath the screen\"; i.e., even though the screen looked immaculate, it was broken, and they determined it was my fault. They tried to charge me more than $160 to replace the LCD screen, after which they said they couldn't be sure I wouldn't have more charges after they were able to turn on the phone. Contrast this experience with the time I actually *did* drop my iPhone 4S and horribly cracked the screen; yet, it still worked. After covering it with a screen protector, it worked perfectly for more than a year when I bought the S6. I decided to start using my 4S until I bought an iPhone 5S off of Craigslist. (Be careful with Craigslist purchases; make sure the seller will meet you in a phone store where they can check that it wasn't stolen.) My iPhone 5S works great. Again, now I understand why people say, \"Once you go Mac...\" This unfortunate experience confirmed for me what so many people have been telling me for years: Apple products just seem more durable.",

This phone has so maby neat features and it is very customizable.. the one thing i do recommend is if you do buy this phone and since the phone is glass i woukd recommend a case.. which one you ask? I have a cheap generic case on ir that i got from a kiask in the mall for like 15 bucks.. i ordered the spigen tough armor and crystal clear case.. i look to expand my case selection even more..",

Amazing phone. BUT, some things have to be pointed out: 1. The phone came from Singapore (as can be seen from some pre-installed apps). 2. So, Samsung Pay (and Samsung Rewards) does not work with non-Singapore local credit cards. Although it could have been clarified in the advertisement by the seller, the problem is related to a Samsung policy, which I clarified directly with Samsung Technical Support in Brazil. The country in Samsung Pay cannot be changed (even if reinstalled locally). I even managed to register my international credit card issued in Brazil, but Samsung Rewards points will be lost because it could only be used in Samsung's Singapore partners. As I use Samsung Pay a lot, this is very disappointing. 3. Came with a (somewhat large) Type G charger (standard for UK, Singapore, Hong Kong) and an adapter for US standard. 4. Did not receive the 128Gb micro SD card. I\u2019d be glad if seller could help with any of these items, or share other related experiences.",

I gave it 3 stars because the seal broken, and the phone was already set up which is weird, as all the phones I've purchased always required charging and set up. Not so sure if it's new or not, apart from that it is a great phone. Update: I have been having trouble with my phone and it hasn't even been a month. the screen sticks, keyboard won't come up. Have to go to home screen, close apps and reopen app. Also, i like always being able to view the time with always on display, the time cuts off almost as if the screen is malfunctioning. I am a bit disappointed after spending so much money on a phone. To early to be experiencing problems",

            "title_review": "Bought for Dual SIM: Got a Great Overall Phone",
            "body": "I did about a month of research prior to purchasing this phone. Comparing online the Samsung S8/S9/S10 and other brands from China. Seeing that I have owned Samsung from the S3 I am partial to the brand as it has always done well for me. I needed a phone in the US to function with two SIM cards simultaneously, one for work one for home, without having two completely different cell phones. I should also say, that I was not interested in an Apple Device. The carrier that both of my SIM cards uses is ATT. At the time of purchase, ATT does not carry a Samsung device in the US that offers a dual SIM capability. In the Box (factory sealed with intact seal): - Galaxy S10 (SM-G973F) - AKG wired headphones w/mic - US wall plug w/USB C cord (charger) - Pre-installed screen protector (brand unknown as it was already on the phone) - Clear plastic case (brand unknown, and offers minimal protection) - 128GB SD Card (not able to use internal to the phone due to my need for 2 seperate SIM cards) - USB C Male to standard USB female adapter (use for data transfer and/or keyboard/mouse capabilities) - Informational material specific to the phone - Internal SIM card holder with dual functionality (Can hold 2 micro SIM Cards or 1 micro SIM and one SD Card) Initial power on and setup: - Battery was 50% +/- charged - Initial power up was in another language, however a drop down menu on the initial screen offered English (Canada). This option was selected and found to be what as needed for proceeding with US setup - Effortless data transfer from Samsung S8 to S10 using Samsung Smart Switch. - The ATT SIM card was plug and play, no additional setup was needed other than inserting the SIM into the phone. Initial impressions/functions of S10: - Dual SIM capability (yes, both are physical SIM cards (no eSIM) - Wireless charging (Yes) - Headphone jack (Yes) - 3 main rear cameras and 1 front camera (all function very well) - Hidden fingerprint scanner (works well) - Facial recognition (works really well, I no longer need to use my fingerprint unless I am in very low light conditions) - Bixby, (another \"helper\" akin to Alexa, Google, etc. I was never really a fan of my phone talking to me, so this will probably be more of a toy than a feature for me personally. However, there is a dedicated button on the left hand side for Bixby. This button can be customized with a tap or double tap for an additional quick launch of an app. I chose a single tap for my camera. - Other interesting, helpful, gimmicky, etc function on the phone. Some are great and add well to the phone. Others, I simply disabled or hid. Dual SIM: The real reason I purchased the phone. - I will start by saying that this international version of the S10 was EXACTLY what I was hoping for in a cell phone. - Two separate physical ATT SIM cards are being used. - On the phone screen I am able to see signal strength for both SIM cards - I am able to set a default SIM card for: 1) Phone Calls, 2) Text, 3) Data. This is done easily with a swipe down from the top of the screen and shown directly below the primary settings (such as WiFi, GPS, BlueTooth, etc.) - However, default does not mean that the \"secondary\" SIM is in standby. - When making calls, I am given the option of easily calling from SIM 1 or SIM 2 (which can also be identified with different symbols rather than numbers, such as a home symbol and work symbol). - When texting, I am given the option of easily sending from SIM 1 or SIM 2, same things with the symbols. - When using data, the phone uses the default setting that was chosen by the user. - The phone is able to receive calls for both phone numbers without having to change settings. - All in all, I am very impressed with the intuitiveness of the design, capability, and ease of use with the dual SIM functionality. Overall Impression: With everything from purchase cost, minimal wait time for delivery, setup, use, and functionality I am very impressed. At this time, there is not a single thing about the phone where I would say \"this could be better\". I will say that I am not a gamer, thus the phone will not be used for them. I cannot comment on how well it would be used for games. I do take many pictures than range from people to panoramic vista views of National Parks and the phone is used as my main daily use camera. Samsung has never let me down in this area. Very happy with this purchase.",

I turned it in for the s10+ and have had no problems with the battery, though it is not quite as robust as Samsung claims. Of course I run dual sim and wifi all day, but I think phone makers should expect that these days. In fairness, Samsung announced it had a smaller battery than the s9+, which I had previously, so I should have read between the lines.",

I usually do not take many selfies; so it is not a big issue for me but if you do, consider this. Other than that i have not had any problems. It works pretty well. Sound is amazing.

The S10, however, is essentially the S8 but better. The OS is snappier and more responsive, which I never knew I wanted from the S8. The finger print scanner is on the front now, which I have mixed feelings on and think I preferred the rear scanner. The Samsung *swipe up to get mad* wallet feature is gone, which is nice. Android Auto is actually significantly better, with improved performance and a redesigned interface. And that's pretty much all I have noticed that is different from the two models. I can't confidently say that this phone is a 700$ upgrade from the S8 when half of the improvements are simply removing Samsung bloat that shouldn't have been there in the first place. But for someone coming from an iPhone or buying a phone from scratch, this is a great choice. I'm giving this 5 stars because the S8 was a near perfect phone for me (save for the bloat), and the S10 sticks closely to the same formula.",

After repeated checks with my service provider it was confirmed that the problem was with the phone and not the service.

Whenever I leave an area with wifi, I have to go to the sim card manager and change from 4g to 3g then back to 4g to get mobile data. As soon as I get a call I lose mobile data and have to go 3g then 4g again to get it back. Same thing if the signal gets weak or I go in and out of a wifi area. Huge risk if attempted while driving.

I was concerned it would be too large for me since I am a female but I have not dropped it so far. The setup is simple and easy. I live in the US and my SIM card worked fine. I use family mobile at Walmart and it works well with the phone. I only see minor glitches like the screen will be slow sometimes and I think it is because I switch browsers a lot. I think that glitches are normal though because I use a new iPhone X at work and the apps crash all the time. Overall super happy with my new phone. I wish the charger was more effective though. It is hard to keep it plugged into the adapter and socket in the wall. The side that fits into the phone port is totally fine.",

I wanted the Prism Green which is officially not available in the US and it looks awesome. Brand New phone in a sealed box. But it has a screen protector pre-installed which is actually a Plus. It also came with a 128GB SD card as a surprise gift which is also nice. Now for the $750 right now it's a total steal.",

            "body": "Thoroughly impressed. And I'm not one to keep up with the newest smartphones, despite coveting them. I was originally planning to get the Huawei Mate 20 Pro but after becoming disheartened by the whole Google/Android/Trump Admn sh*t, I had to quickly find the next new phone for me because I couldn't stand holding onto my old one any longer (it was a Huawei phone as well--it'd been good to me). Low-key wanted to have a phone with that Snapdragon core since everyone raves about it, but truly no longer care because so far the Galaxy S10 has been a dream. I love love love it. My only two cons are the battery life draining a little quicker than I like for a new phone (I feel like Androids in general are just like this) and the fingerprint scanner and face recognition being a tad slow (it's my first time having a phone with biometrics, and its slow to me). Other than that I don't regret buying this.",

            "body": "If you are wearing sunglasses then it gets annoying but when you are not then it works great. I drive 12 hours a day and during day time in summer, I'm almost always wearing sunglasses until sunset. So until then my face recognition doesn't work. And I don't like fingerprint unlock as it means I have to tap on my phone screen and put my finger in exact position on the scanner, which I'm very bad at doing so while I'm driving a semi. On the other hand, battery life is amazing on this phone. Far better than my old phone s7edge which hardly lasted half day of minor use. This one on the other hand leaves me with 30% after all day of use on single charge. Not a big social media using guy. If you are driving around then the battery is used up a lot more than when I'm home. Camera is very neat and night mode and all the slow mo and 4K stuff is pretty cool. Display is absolutely gorgeous as you would expect from a Samsung device. In fact, I had to turn off the 4k resolution and use only HD version or something to quiet it down a little bit. As my eyes are still used to s7 display. Over all, I love this phone and Samsung as always been my number one choice for Android phones for a good reason.",

Phone calls sound clear and mic works fine. Camera is Great. Phone was compatible for my (Sim Card) that I recieved from tmobile. Also It had Tmobile programmed in it but it is unlocked so I would assume any Sim should work... Dislikes: Phone has cosmetic damages. Minor scrapes along edges could be due to usage or previous maintenance. Screen is new however there was a very small indentation in it (No Scratches Though). \"Product is renewed so its not served in an original package with original accessories. Instead it has an off brand charger, used off brand headphones, and off brand charger base.\" If you don't plan on buying a case and want a brand new phone for the look of a brand new phone I wouldn't recommend this, but if you are in need of a phone for a cheaper price, with great functionality, and plan on buying a case, I would recommend you checking this product out.",

The phone came in near pristine condition apart from miniscule scratches on the screen and a paint chip here or there along the edge. You'll literally need a magnifying glass, the right angle in the light, and a nitpicky mood. It being T-mobile unlocked was perfect for me because I just wanted a phone upgrade and keep the same carrier. It was as simple as popping in the SIM card and all my features were available (wifi calling, etc.) And the pen works nicely! The battery drains a bit quick even after I think I've done my best in minimizing app usage, but I've only had to recharge once so far within a 10 hour time frame. If you don't need the Note10's features and want to dodge that big price tag, this is a great purchase. I've only used it for a day so far. If something changes drastically, I will update this review",

            "body": "I have Metro PCS and I was very interested in buying a device compatible with my service features such as wi-fi calling and caller ID. Not to mention full capabilities to utilize network connectivity. I ordered two other Samsung devices, both International versions and I had issues with both (A50 and A70). Both stopped receiving text messages after a couple of days. Tech support wasn't able to figure it out, I read all the blogs online and concluded that international versions are not 100% compatible, hence why they're cheaper. Then I found this, I was debating between the OnePlus 7 PRO and the S10+, but I also didn't want to spend too much. Then I found this Tmobile Note 9, OnePlus wasn't a challenger due to the lack of micro sd slot. \u2022 It is unlocked. \u2022 It is a Tmobile phone. (Tmobile boot up) \u2022 Pristine condition. (Zero blemishes) \u2022 Battery works as it should. (I had this phone before brand new). \u2022 It doesn't include an original Samsung fast charger. This doesn't bother me as I have plenty. For the price it's hands down the best phone you can get, this is a flag ship device. Waterproof, expandable memory, 4k 60fps quality video, super vivid screen. This phone was $1000 brand new just a few months ago. I can't even tell its used! Buy it, you won't regret it.",

However, mine could be screen replaced! Touch screen is not smooth at all. When I touch the icons on the screen, sometime it works sometimes it doesn't. Also the phone is not completely unlocked, so sometimes I can use mobile data, sometimes I cannot! I love to save money, so I buy refurbished one. However, I think it's not worth saving! Just by luck! I bought Samsung Note 8 couple months ago for my kid and it was ok but this one is suck!",

Only partially compatible with Mint mobile LTE some areas, a real drawback since that was my plan. Rural areas occasionally loose signal on Mint mobile urban is fine. Fingerprint reader is slow to work, have to unlock with key code many times, but updates improved faceunlock feature. Phone has CDMA frequency bands missing since it is not built for US only International. It is not 100 percent compatible with some US carriers. But it still works on GSM.

Huge screen, fast performance, great cameras (I love the widescreen camera for taking photos of rooms for work). The battery is huge and easily lasts all day with 30-40% remaining, even with very heavy use. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the frequencies to do 4G in the US. AT&T will still be supporting the H+ 3.5G network (which I get about 4Mb/s transfers on) until Feb 2022, so don't expect to use this phone past then. I have decent coverage with the H+ network, but not as good as the 4G. I can still stream video and music with no issues, but had I researched more about the 4G not working, I wouldn't have bought the phone. If Samsung brings this to the US with the proper frequencies, this would be a 5 star phone. My only other desire would be wireless charging but other than that, this phone has everything. I purchased this phone elsewhere, before it was available on Amazon.",

            "body": "Phone is not fully compatible with AT&T in most markets. The Nokia 4.2 can be provisioned to work on the AT&T network, but in most markets, will not be able to work on the 4G/LTE channels. What does this mean? Without LTE, your mobile data speeds will be reduced to about 6mbs download (on a good day, with a good signal) to less than 1mbs (most common conditions). Upload speeds are about 20% of the D/L speed. This incompatibility needs to be more clearly indicated. (For techies: this phone only has a few of the authorized LTE frequencies, and does not include those most frequently used by AT&T.) For those who do not need LTE speeds for data, this phone does offer very long battery life. The screen is acceptable if you view it straight-on (the LCD has a narrow viewing range, which is helpful in preventing someone sitting next to you from \"couch-surfing\" your info.) The adaptive brightness control really needs to either be turned off entirely OR manually push the brightness to more than 70%, before turning on the adaptive brightness control. (The adaptive brightness control is very flaky at lower settings, under all lighting conditions.) Contacted seller through Amazon's service re: lack of LTE compatibility for AT&T and have not heard back from them. Will update when (and if) they ever respond.",

This phone does all I need it to plus, great not to have all of the bloatware that the contract models have. It does have some quirks but exploring it a little further it has all the capabilities of a pricier phone. Camera is great, the phone runs all of my apps without any issues. It is all Google, but no problem for me. The message indicator light is built into the power key, fantastic - just be aware that most cases will block the indicator. I'm trying a few different case to see which works. Also, I have to say that Nokia support when contacted was outstanding! It ended up being my error, but they were on target with help.",

            "body": "*Update: the battery is trash. It doesn't last (me) a full day and I just use it to text and scroll social media. That's with the battery saver option on. Also the Google Asst button is annoying bc it's too easy to inadvertently push when you don't want to. But I've learned you can disable the button altogether so that's helpful. And for some reason you can't install the Amazon shopping app on this phone, it says it's not compatible? I haven't found a case that doesn't obscure the power button's light so unless you plan on using the phone with no case, don't plan on utilizing the notification light. Of course you could get a clear case but it yellows over time..eww. I ended up returning and got a Moto G7 which I love. Battery lasts forever and it's a faster phone with a huge display. Observations: The screen isn't very bright unless you have it all the way up, like 85% . The camera has a delay before it actually takes a photo. Annoying when you're trying to take pics of kids, pets, etc. The photos look pretty decent though. The fingerprint sensor is placed lower than it should be so it's not very practical. I've just been using the pin to unlock since it's faster than face recognition. I do like the Google Assistant button on the side, it's pretty handy. And the power button lights up when you have notifications, this is a nice to have. And it came with earbuds. Overall for the price, I like it. And it has NFC!",

            "body": "I needed a budget Android Smart Phone that was well built had good battery life and a useable version of Android. And the NOKIA 4.2 has all these things. Before I go any further with this review I need to clarify a few things. I did not need or want a phone to play music all day, stream movies or play games. I needed one that was a good phone send a few texts get onto the internet when I needed to and maybe take a picture now or then. This phone can also do those other things. But will it be as good as a 1,000.00 high end smart phone probably not. But if you are looking for an entry level unlocked smart phone for 189.00 it is probably one of the best. The way I use my phone it is very reliable and has fantastic battery life. And even better the only software on it when you get it is Android version 9. This is the first android phone that I have ever owned that I can truly say is easy to use. There is no bloatware and no one has screwed up the interface. The only thing you are going to find on this phone is what you put there. The one thing I do not like is I would like to be able to make it go loader when on speaker phone. I have not done any streaming or music with it. So you will have to find a different review for that. But if you are looking for a good phone to get you through your day this is it.",

One thing the phone lacks is a USB-C port, but at this price, the phone is still a very good value. UPDATE: I have discovered that the audio output through the 3.5 mm jack is poor quality. The volume is unstable, and it is very noticeable when listening to music. The best way I can describe it is that the sound \"trembles,\" and this happens regardless of which music app or which wired headphones I use. Perhaps my phone is defective and I could get a replacement under warranty, but I doubt that I will bother, considering that I do not use the 3.5 mm jack very often. The phone admittedly feels a bit cheap, and I am afraid that a replacement unit would have a more significant defect.",

            "body": "The Nokia 4.2 is a beautiful phone - it does everything I need it to (web browsing, email, text, call). However I know that the processor is pretty slow, so I wouldn't recommend for any gamers. The camera is top notch, and the look and feel of the phone makes it seem like it should have cost double what it did. I love how the power button lights up when you have either a notification or it's charging. I would be hard pressed to find a phone this good for under $200. Adding a MicroSD card is optional, it has plenty of room already, and all of your photos are uploaded to Google. I have two main gripes: It doesn't have dual band wifi, meaning it cannot pick up a 5GHZ network, this isn't a huge deal but I'd imagine in 2019 all phones would have dual band. The other gripe is the micro-usb. I wish it were type-c. Oh well, you can get a Nokia 6.1 or Pureview for Type C and dual band, but for the price, this phone is outstanding.",

            "body": "I will never go to one of the big brand cellular stores ever again. And I will never buy the big budget smart phones ever again. A little background on me just to compare yourself to. I am 43 yr old male who works in design/web/video production field. United States. I have AT&T or GSM network. Yes it works on At&t. The way I see it we have come to a point where all the phones do the exact same thing and may have a couple of very small but not really noticeable or necessary features. Its like buying a car now compared to the 80s. well all cars now have AC Heat and the auto windows etc. Thats standard. well the same goes for phones. They all run the same apps. Yeah one may run a little faster but it isnt so fast that you can actually see the difference. I think the biggest thing is the camera . the cam on this is not horrible but its not like some of the newer phones (like the new phones now have 3 cameras on them oh wow!!!). But i dont really care because i just bought a pro camera a couple of months ago and i was never really one to use my phone cam that much anyway. im not a selfie guy. I would put this phone up against any other phone. The screen is big the apps run fast. im sure if you have to many open you may see the difference compared to a phone with a better processor but i tend to only have 5 apps open at the most on any phone i use. I did a lot of research on this before i bought it and this was my first time buying a phone outright and outside the phone stores. After researching youtube and watching them compare the phones speeds side by side I decided to give it a shot. I have to say it is well worth it. take a look at the speed comparison online reviews. To get a phone that cost 1/8th the cost of some new phones is amazing. I did my calculations and came to the conclusion that paying this price and not having to get insurance like you do on the other phones is the best way to go. If you think about it the other ones you pay 15$ per month ins. and still have to pay a deductible of 100 dollars to fix and they only give you a refurb replacement phone not a new one. With this i pay no ins. and just get a new phone for the same price and the way technology works by the time I need or break this phone the phones that will be out then will be even better than this one in terms of speed etc for the same price. Oh and the fact that you dont even have to go to AT&T etc to get the phone turned on or transfer files seals the deal. I literally got the device from the mail box, walked in to my house made one last text on my old phone. Pulled the sim card out put it in the new phone and was immediately able to continue the text chat i was having. Then the best part there is and app that pops up thats called smart switch. you put it on both your new phone and your old phone and then it will transfer everything to your new phone. And I mean everything. It took all the apps all my favorites in web. all my settings on apps all of it. It even took my settings from my poker game that i play. I have it set to not make noise or vibrate when im playing and all that info transferred as well. I didnt have to redo. So its a no brainer to me. If you want to save over 1000 dollars on a phone and insurance and deductible costs go with this phone or one of the other A series phones that cost a little more than this one if you are not sure. A10 A20 A30 A40 A50. You will not be disappointed. Technology/phone prices should go down over the yrs not up. If you havent heard I phones etc only cost like 2 to 300 dollars for them to make and we are paying 1200 for them. They charge that because people are willing to pay that even though there has been no significant change in the phones in the last 3 yrs.",

            "body": "OK, I'll be totally honest. I don't play games on my phone I typically send text messages, check news & weather, listen to music and yes...make phone calls. The display is gorgeous! even for a 720p OLED display. Fingerprint reader and face unlock work REALLY well, and the audio is incredible when paired with the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth earbuds. I was looking for a replacement for my Apple iPhone 7Plus but in the end, I had to install a different launcher to speed it up and I really missed the wireless pay feature I had. So instead of going back to my iPhone, I ended up returning this one and getting a Samsung A70 (bigger, higher-res display & google pay). If you're looking for a really good budget phone and you don't play games, then you found it! I'd also recommend the SunRemex Carbon Fiber Designed Galaxy A20 Case for this phone. It's so good I purchased the same case for my Samsung A70.",

            "body": "I decided to stop trying to get my Galaxy J7 Sky Pro to screen mirror because it doesn't have the ability natively. Apps worked once in a blue moon. Decided to get a phone that is supposed to have screen mirroring ability built in. The A20 is supposed to mirror my device but it's been a struggle getting it to work. Been to the Samsung forum and I guess I should have gone there first. Way too many posts from people that can't get this to work with their Samsung phones. All of them, not just the A20. There was a post from someone that had in International phone and the forum wouldn't help him because of that. The forum is for US phones. Found 2 different methods that work! It'll do till I get the Actiontec Screenbeam (and I hope it works) I ordered. Returning an EZCast hdmi adapter that didn't work. I have my Roku TV connected to an adapter with my Huion drawing tablet/monitor. They are mirrored when I have my computer selected on Roku. Method 1) I tried about 20 apps. I finally found one and only one app that works with my A20 (Screen Cast Mirroring by MOBZAPP). I even paid the $4.99 to get rid of the ads I like it so much. First app I've ever bought! Unless you've rooted your phone, the sound will still be from the phone. MOBZAPP has an app for the sound issue if your phone is rooted. I won't be doing that. Medhod 2) Go to google play and get the teamviewer app for Samsung (free for home use). It'll tell you to go to their web-site and you'll download an app for your pc and your phone will give you a \"partner id\" number. You input that in the program on your pc. And there it is, your phone on your pc. The sound is still coming from your phone. This would have worked on my J7 phone as well. It's less than perfect, but I can watch shows from my Mobdro app. It's a great app. It looks much better with the A20 having 720p resolution. And the feed is more stable with the better processors and more ram. One really nice surprise was the 128 gb micro sd card instead of the 32 gb card I was expecting. And a game I played on the J7 was really slow and it is faster on the A20. Like everyone else I love the screen. And the dark mode is great. As I use it I find more things to appreciate about the phone. I was VERY upset after I first tried to mirror the phone and couldn't get it to work for 2 days. And it still takes an app or hardware. Love the screen-saver! I get to see my artwork. Which is beautiful on the A20 display, if I do say to myself.",

            "body": "Device is performing as expected and more, maybe because I skip models and change only when there is a need to. Down sides u can cope with are 1-Resolution 1080, not noticeable, I don't have a note10+ to compare it to but my old note 5 with the higher resolution is there and the lower res is not a big deal. 2- Battery, yes..smaller than the 10+ but enough to keep up to the end of the day with more than average use and with some juice remaining, actually..impressed by it and don't understand the fuss. 3- Camera, as I heard, as good as the 10+ apart from the extra lens which claimed to be useful for bokeh images (I don't care about that). 4- This is the one I miss, the type c headphones instead of the 3.5 mm, mainly because of my Bose QC acoustic ($ 249 on amazon today)..what a waste if not for the occasional laptop use. The good sides 1- the battery..yes again..and only because it turned out to be much better than what I expected after reading all those reviews. 2- The display size, and that maybe also I compare it to my old note 5 with the bigger bezels. Bottom line happy with the purchase..had been waiting for some time until I bought this one (back of my head was thinking that oneday they will quit those curved screen, but they kept going on and on and eventually I had to replace my phone).",

I stopped carrying a charger to work with me. The quality is unbelievable. Feels like a flagship phone for a quarter of the price. Plays games just fine with little to no lag. I play Pokemon go and RuneScape, along with other idle games just fine. Beware, cases are difficult to find for this exact model. The included one is cute, but I needed something a little better in my line of work.",

The fact that this phone has 128GB of storage, 6GB of RAM, top-notch cameras (main and selfie), USB-C, and NFC for tap-and-pay, all for less than $300 is mind boggling in the current market for flagship quality mid-range smartphones. I also have the Redmi Note 7, and it managed to only temporarily pry me from my Galaxy S9+. All of these features, along with excellent battery life, have led to the Mi 9 Lite successfully taking the place of my S9+ as my daily driver.",

            "body": "I have had it almost a month now and so far, so good. I Don't want to jinx myself or anything. But it arrived on time, well packaged, complete. Was easy to set up, although it may be a bit harder than I thought to unlock it for you use with a CDMA network (I also have Boost Mobile, along with AT&T) but I would like to get it set up for that as well. My only real complaint is the dual SIM slot. If you want to use both your SIM cards, you can't get your SD card in it's slot bc one of the SIM slots shares the space for the SD card. But other than that, I'm happy with it. Great sound, great screen, GREAT flagship grade camera, excellent battery life, in screen finger print scanner doesn't always get it the first time but I think my thumb might be bigger than the area the scanner resides in, works well with AT&T down here in Tennessee, and has a surprisingly fast Snapdragon 710 in it (it was either this, the Mi 9T Pro, or the Redmi Note 8 Pro) honestly I think I'd been happy with any of the three I just named off lol they're good phones for a good price.",

After 2 days of moderate usage, its down to 35% which is not bad. The phone looks astonishing. I was highly impressed the moment I opened the package. The bloatware is little annoying but its not too much and pros definitely outweigh this con. The camera works great. The portrait mode is doing its job and I am impressed. This phone under $300 is definitely a class. As of now, highly recommended. I will write again after a month of usage. I am rating 4 just because of little bloatware (Not too much) but its definitely worth 5 rating.",

            "body": "Bought this as a backup/travel device, been using it for a week before writing a review. Overall useful as a daily phone for most tasks outside maybe pubg or COD. Performance: This is the 2GB version and it's responsive enough to handle most web browsing in chrome or firefox mobile, hangouts video chats, Discord, and basic day to day office tasks you'd need for work. Everything feels quite responsive outside a few minor things I believe are bugs in the recent MIUI 11 update on the phone I am sure will be worked out, enabling wif/blutooth is a tad slow but works. If you aren't going to push this phone to gaming you should be fine for most all tasks feeling responsive. CPU is a bit weaker as this phone is geared at battery life over performance. Battery: With office tasks, ~2-3 hours of youtube 480p, discord, and some web browsing. I was down to about 20% after 3.5 days from 100%. This was with me enabling battery saver from 20:00-7:00 and using android dark mode, mileage may vary depending. Overall this is a perfect phone for anyone planning to be out all day and cares more about their phone lasting the full day(or two) than being able to game on the go. Features: Lacks NFC, Fingerprint, and some other things but overall it's not a deal breaker. Fast charging is nice, headphone jack, FM radio, IR blaster are as well; but this phone ships with a 10w charger for full Q.C. you can, and should, get an 18w charger as the battery will need it to go from 20%->100% in a reasonable time. Screen is not 2k but looks good enough even with full brightness not to be bad, it does tend to wash out a bit in full color but it's nothing offensive. Dual sim + SD card is really good for travel. Camera: This won't win any awards but for most pictures it looks and acts fine, plenty of reviews for the full images out there though I will say the latest update did fix a few things with quality. I hear you can also side load the gcam in but I haven't tried it yet. The camera is good enough to get the job done, the AI mode can help a few minor touches as well. If you're just going to share daytime pictures with people via social media, this camera will get the job done with ease but it's no pixel/hawuei camera. Overall good phone for travel or a phone for someone non-power user. Going to be using this on a few of my trips so that I don't need to worry so much on a power bank wherever I go. Things to keep in mind not all 4g bands supported in USA disable ads in MIUI via turning off \"suggestions\" get an 18W wall charger for best charge times this does not come with any case, while it is sturdy would suggest a case",

            "body": "Bought this after 1ft drop cracked my Samsung Galaxy S9+ and although it lacks some features I'll miss, finger print reader, NFC, and wireless charging, this phone has enough going for it that at less than 1/5 the price what it does have and the quality puts it at top of the value proposition for cell phones. Face unlock is quick enough that I only slightly miss the finger print reader. 5000mAh battery helps overcome the convenience of wireless charging. I'll miss the NFC as backup to my credit cards but only a lower tier feature for me. 32GB storage is usable, the expandable SD storage makes tolerable, even though moving apps to SD doesn't appear possible. Biggest drawback I've found at this point that I've had some issues with weak WiFi signal pickup, no issue at home but have struggled to get strong signal at work. Still working through some of the quirks of the Xiaomi interface but expect overtime i'll become more familiar with it, fairly intuitive just different. I haven't spent much time with the camera and evaluating image quality so cannot comment there but with everything else going for it it frankly doesn't matter to me. Only been using for 24 hours so longer term use may expose some flaws but at this point no question at $110 I would buy again and recommend.",
