            "title_review": "Decent Smart Phone (Review based on Sprint Network)",
            "body": "I've had this phone for a little over a month and have been pleased with it thus far. It has Windows Mobile 6.1 on it which has a few updates from version 6.0 such as frequently used programs on the start menu, and threaded text messages. The threaded text messages come in handy when determining context of a message. The keyboard allows for typing primarily with the thumbs and can take a bit of getting used to the tiny size but you get the hang of it after a while. Another drawback of the small keyboard size is the necessity to use the Fn key to enter numbers or special characters. A USB cable comes with the phone and is useful when transferring files between a computer and the phone. Using the ative sync capabilities to link Outlook email with the phone is very useful in staying in touch with people while on the go. When taking a picture or video with the phone, you can immediately send it to an email address via Outlook. For those who use Microsoft Communicator Instant Messenger, it is also possible to load the IM program on the phone and communicate with people via IM. The phone additionally has GPS capabilities and if you download Google Maps, is very useful for obtaining directions when out and about. By adding a memory card, you can boost the storage capabilities and might choose to load music, pictures, or video files if using this option. You can use the mobile internet platform and it works decently well for obtaining basic news, weather, or email from applications such as Gmail. It is not as robust or smooth as using a device such as an iPhone but gets the job done. I recommend disabling the loading of pictures to help with download speed. If you sign up for an unlimited data service plan, you may also consider using the internet sharing functionality. This provides the ability to use your phone as a modem for your computer via USB cable, which is valuable for those who travel frequently or move from place to place with a laptop and still need internet access. The speed on the Sprint network has been comparable to wireless access in a hotel room.",

            "body": "Be warned: on any of their Pda/Smartphone type device, Verizon has no GetitNow, no Mobile Web, and many apps available for regular phones are off limits. On my previous Verizon phone, I could get a 24-hour sub to VZ Navigator when I needed it (which amounted to roughly 4 times in a year). Having the GPS for $3 when I needed it was awesome. When you upgrade to a PDA, Verizon does not tell you that the only way to get the VZ Navigator working is the monthly sub. And you'd have to call customer support, and have it added. GPS on this device is locked to VZ Navigator. It actually makes more sense getting a GPS Bluetooth receiver, like Garmin 10. Why did I switch to it and why did I not get a phone like the Voyager? Because Contact list where all you have are 5 phones and 2 emails is a joke. I want to store addresses, birthdays, IM ids, and whatever other info there is. In the contacts department, Moto Q9c delivers in spades. Overall impression: I like the device, it is very slim and light, all the buttons have a nice tactile feel, and navigation is easy after a little getting used to, lots of customization options. The default screen setup is quirky, but you can load 3rd party software - especially once you application unlock. Add a spacious miniSD card(2GB can be had for less than $10), and you can store apps, ringtones, music etc there. 2GB cards cost less than $10 these days. ActiveSync makes PC communication a snap. Email was setup in 5 minutes. For internet, you are better off using mobile versions of sites (like m.ebay.com) While Verizon does put in roadblocks, the coverage, signal, call quality, and data speed are all great. If someone cracks the internal GPS so you can use Google Maps with it, the way you can on the Sprint version, that would be perfect.",

            "body": "This is my second Q. The main reason I upgraded was because after checking it out at a Verizon store, the salesperson showed me HIS Q9C and how it worked with Google Maps and Windows Live Maps. After using it for a couple of weeks and researching this to death, they lock the GPS functionality unless you subscribe to Verizon Navigator for an extra $10 per month. Not what I saw with my own eyes and not what I understood when I bought it. The GPS functionality of the phone should work with whatever application I can run on the phone. Without that functionality it is of no more value than the original Q. The new Windows Mobile 6.x OS adds nothing.",

Earlier review: I still like my Palm 750P best, but this is the closest I could find, Pros: it has a hardware & on screen keyboard; has a fully configurable wi-fi hotspot; it allows you to block most automatic online activity to save both battery & data charges, Cons: no simple means of syncing with my desktop like my Palm; the built-in notepad SUCKS with no \"Memo\" feature like Palm; cutting & pasting is not as intuitive as on the Palm, in fact it's a pain in the ass.",

As far as Droid Pros themselves, I liked mine for the most part while I had it. But I went through three of them, and each of them had charging port issues. My friend has also had two Droid Pros that the charging port became loose in and stopped working. I have an iPhone now, but as far as Droids go, I really liked this one.",

            "title_review": "Motorola Droid Pro: Keep it simple!",
            "body": "I have recently made the change from a HTC One M7 to a Droid Pro. I did this because I wear my device on my belt everyday and wanted to ditch the bulk. If you keep your expectations in check, this device works! The Droid Pro is from 2010, which is a relic by today's standards. It operating system is Android 2.3.3, which is obviously out of date, but all the basics are there. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to kill tasks and close apps as they are opened. Other than downloading an app from the Play store, there is no way to do this. Bluetooth works great with my Ford Sync system. It keeps connection to it better than previous phones that I had owned. Wi-Fi, Vibration alerts and call quality have been great! Battery life has been good as well. The key for this phone is, the more modern apps you put on this phone, the more bogged down it will be. Facebook, Messenger and Linkedin made this phone slow down big time. Ebay is the only \"social media\" app that I installed. That application runs smoothly and works perfect. Basic weather widgets, Mr. Number and email sync work great. Internet is fine but you wouldn't want to do much surfing on such a small screen. Battery life has not been an issue at all. I get emails all day long, use the vibration alerts, keep Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on all day, battery at the end of day is 75% charged. I do have it in \"Maximum Battery Saver\" which seems to help. So the biggest plus is the size and the Otterbox (and other cases) that can be bought. With such a small screen, this phone is easy to carry on my belt. I use my old HTC One M7 at home for surfing and social media. Since social media it is not installed on my Droid Pro, I won't get alerts that I don't want or be tempted to check it during the day. It is nice to step away from it when you are out. For the right person, this is a good phone. Keep the expectations in check and you will enjoy using the Droid Pro.",

The biggest issue I had with this phone is the charging port. It failed way too soon and upon researching it, apparently it is a common defect with Samsung phones. I think they know that. I never had any issues with overheating or anything like that, just that the port became loose and eventually would not take a charge. I had to get an external charger and several extra batteries to keep the phone running. Otherwise, I really love this phone. Great camera on it too. Of course, it is now outdated by 5 newer models. Ahh technology... :0) RIP my beloved S3...",

            "body": "The phone is really great - I just love it! Easy to use, slim in the hand and has all the features you could want in a phone and so much more. The problem is this: it is great to have all the apps you could possibly want, all the features that make life easy and the phone terrific, Google+ and all the features it allows you to do on this phone....BUT....with all of this loaded on your phone (Like I had) the battery lasts all of a few hours once it is off the charger. When I first got the phone, I was thrilled that the battery lasted all day and didn't need a charge until I was ready to go to bed. But then I started adding widgets, apps, games, music, photos, videos and the battery just dwindled down. I was having to literally keep the phone plugged in by 3:00PM until bedtime. I tried to study the phone and see what was eating up the battery all day and started uninstalling, putting the phone to the bare minimum with backlights, synching -- and now my phone lasts all day -- the sad part is all those features, apps, music, Google+ and searching is no longer on my phone but HEY the battery lasts all day again. Very disappointed that you can have such a GREAT phone with so many cool features and then not be able to use them unless your phone is literally plugged in all day. I am keeping the phone because I got such a great deal on it - had I purchased the Galaxy s4 at $250 I would have been super pissed about it. Now I just add in apps I want them, delete them when I don't need them and have to keep watch over the battery life. You know Samsung - if you really want to take over the market with your awesome phones - and they are really awesome -- you need to figure out the battery life and provide the 'extra' large battery with the phone not at the $50 price point. Other than the battery - the phone really is a great phone with wonderful features if you don't mind having samsung phone plugs at home, near your couch, in your car, on your desk at work and one in your purse or bag in case you're somewhere and your battery is declining - it goes fast once it gets to 20%. Just sayin....",

When I checked back on my account that afternoon. I got sorta scared cuz. The seller that I ordered the phone from, had stated that it had \"Heavy\" scratches on it and that it was locked to att. It may have stratches on it. Which, They are hardly noticeable. and I can use my SIM card in it. Im a GoPhone User BTW. And It's a pretty good phone. just as good as an iPhone. Many of the apps available in the Apple app store. Can pretty musch be downloaded from the Google Play Store. So, for those of you peeps looking for an iPhone but may not be able to afford it. Get the Samsung Galaxy SIII. The \"S\" stands for \"Super\". So If y'all thing about it. The Samsung Galaxy \"S\"uperIII. So, If you are looking for a phone that the seller says has heavy stratches on it. Thay are very light and hardly noticeable. good luck.",

Other phone lasted more than a day. I would not have realized the problem if we had not bought two. Called Amazon and they arranged for a replacemet immediately. Service and follow-up by Amazon was great. New phone works exactly like the other phone now. The replacement phone was not a reconditioned phone like you get from At&T or Verizon.",

The phone arrived quickly no problems setting it up. I Love the size and quality of the phone! I need a bigger screen and this is it! Easy to navigate through and it has video help through the phone to help with whatever you need. Bright and so many features i'm completely happy with it. Easy to hold and talk on it. Battery life isn't the greatest but it's not too bad I mean it is a smart phone and with apps it does tend to drain some of the battery but that doesn't bug me at all.Great phone!",

Be careful when it is charging not to move the phone because some connection piece inside the phone will easily break off and then you have to send it to Samsung to get it fixed.

I thought I'd really be missing out by switching to Android, but boy, was I wrong! This is the best phone I have ever owned. I order the white one, and my husband ordered the blue. We had no problems setting up the phones or talking to AT&T to confirm that our plans were the way we wanted them. During checkout, some of our plan options were not available (namely my unlimited data plan), so I had to call AT&T to make sure everything was as it should be. I waited until after we received our bill to post this review. Folks, if you have an unlimited data plan you CAN keep it when you upgrade your phones through Amazon. I have had an unlimited data plan since 2006 or thereabouts, and it's still listed on our bill after a complete billing cycle. Although I'm not the biggest AT&T fan, there were not difficult at all about letting me keep my plan.",

So, when I checked out the Samsung I fell in love with it online. I really wanted the S4 but I couldn't afford it so I settled for the S3. I tell you this is the best phone ever. I've used the iphone and honestly the Samsung s3 is far better. It has a better screen and the overall feel of the phone is better. I'm not real sure why people are so crazy about the iphone. The Samsung is so much better.",

The original back plastic bit seems to be missing a letter so now the back plate says \"Sa sung\" but I was buying a case to cover the phone anyways. So not a big deal. Android, in my opinion, is far superior to any other OS for a phone. You can customize any aspect of a the device you want which is a huge plus unlike iPhone whichhas must stuff locked at stock use. Both devices server as a phone and send texts well, but android devices offer more for the same price so logically speaking it would make sense to purchase something with more.",

            "body": "SO after owning this phone for roughly has been living up to the hype. I just discovered that I can stream my photos and music via xbox 360 the other day playing around in the setting. there are a lot of neat features like the turn over feature when the phone rings just turn it over and it goes silent. The battery life doesn't last as long as I want it to(even after turning auto syncing and other background running apps) I can make it half way through a day worth of battery life with casual browsing, emails, very little music streaming and video. The calls (to me) are not as loud or clear when using the ear piece however it has some volume when using the speaker(which is what I use) Also, I have a cassette converter that I plug into the headphone jack so I can hear music and/or talk on the phone. Now, the phone says it comes with 16 gb of data, but in reality with pre-installed apps it comes with about 12gb of space; however it is expandable with a micro sd card I believe up to 32gb. BEWARE... I purchased five movies through google play thinking they were transferrable to vudu player or UV cloud and its NOT. So if I do not have an android phone I am pretty much screwed with those five movies I purchased and can only use it with an android phone :( My 3 yr old was disappointed she couldn't watch her movies through the xbox vudu player :/ The same goes for music!.. at least through apple you can transfer music to other devices besides an iphone, ipod or ipad. ONLY purchase movies through vudu the license to the movies are transferrable and you have the option to download them to ANY device...that is the ONLY downside to google play.. a HUGE NEGATIVE for me. Other than that the phone is fairly responsive, no lags or freezing, only when I got close to filling up the internal memory with apps. So, if you like to download different apps (like myself) this phone is not for you unless you don't mind uninstalling them and deleting a different app to install the one you DO want to use.. very complicated in that aspect and kind of annoying.",

If you want this phone, you'll have to purchase a new battery on top of it($15-20). So I'd recommend buying it elsewhere. It's cheap so you get what you pay for and end up spending the \"saved\" cash on better parts. I'm keeping mine, but that was VERY disappointing. It IS a good phone otherwise. But I don't know what would be the better trade off. I was hoping for a phone that y'know... actually had a battery. But at least I like the phone itself~",

I'd also like to point out that you activated my new phone prior to shipping and in turn, it shut my old phone off so I was without cell until new one arrived. Extremely aggravating as I use my phone for work. Also no packing slip or order information included. This appears to be a used phone. I did not use my upgrade and spend extra $ to buy used.

            "title_review": "Galaxy S3 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water!",
            "body": "I have been an iPhone fan for a long time and let me tell you that the Galaxy S3 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water. I was skeptical at first about the Galaxy S3 because I was not sure how it would compare against the iPhone 5 but there's no competition because the Galaxy S3 wins hands down. I was blown away by this phone and I can't stop using it everywhere I go. It easily lasts a full day with a single charge and there's always around 20% left at the end of the day which is nice. Even my family who has been using an iPhone since they first came out is blown away by this phone. I have even caught them using my phone when they thought I was sleeping because they just love the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I chose this phone over the iPhone 5 but the main reason is the screen size and the battery. It got to the point where the iPhone was too small for my hands and I'd have to charge it at least four times a day. These are some things that the Galaxy S3 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones: Pros: -Screen: The Galaxy S3 has a nice 4.8 inch Super AMOLED screen that makes everything stand out when you see it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 720 x 1280 which makes every look sharp. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5(640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way to small for most people. -Android OS: This phone now ships with Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. The phone feels way faster than Android 4.0.4 (ICS) thanks to project butter which makes the CPU work at a high frequency as soon as you touch the screen to reduce lag and slow downs. -Design: I was getting tired of the same design with the iPhone and the Galaxy S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold it. -Camera: The camera on this phone is super awesome and takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. Even the front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself. -Battery: The battery wasn't that good with Android 4.0.4 (ICS) but with the release of Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), the phone lasts me now 2x as long as before. I can get through a day with a single charge and I can still have 20% left at the end of the day. -Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never be full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures and videos and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play games that require a minimum of 1GB space. -Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing GTA Vice City that was just released on the highest settings and there was no slow downs whatsoever. I was very impressed. -Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this? I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Cons: -S Voice: Doesn't really work most of the time for me. I have to constantly repeat the same thing so it hears it correctly. -Fingerprint magnet: While this may bother some, this can easily be fixed by buying a case. Overall it's a great phone and doesn't disappoint. With the amazing high resolution and screen size, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S3 is the best phone of 2012.",

            "body": "I purchased this phone on the Sprint carrier. I was previously an iPhone user, however after familiarizing myself with the Android operating system and the Google Play Store, I was ready to take the leap \"to the dark side\". Hardware: This phone is BLAZING fast. ULTRA responsive. You click to open an app, and BAM! the app is open, without hesitation. I _LOVE_ the screen. Sorry, I have read and read reviews on this phone and its competitors, but I, as your average 30-something year old female user, find it to be brightly lit, easy to read, crisp, LARGE, detailed, , and with a pixel count that is gratifying. I _LOVE_ the huge display. Netflix, with some ear buds in sucks me right in! I am in lurve :). Software: Honestly, I don't know enough about the different Andriod OS's to say that this particular OS is any better or worse than the most recent (Ice Cream Sandwich) or earlier variations of it. I will say that the apps that I have installed on it are very responsive and snap right open, without _any_ delay. I won't mention the differences between the iOS and the Android OS (I'm not familiar with the Windows mobile OS), as it's apples and oranges. Camera: It has both front and back cams. Toddlers LOVE this lol. Hand them your phone to check themselves out in and it's almost as entertaining as Netflix! At 8 Megapixels on the outward facing camera, and the fact that it has a flash, 5x7 prints won't look like that on your average phone! The video is _slightly_ jumpy, however, it's clear in both image and sound quality. Speaker: This sucker can get LOUD! Which is awesome! Does it sound like a little speaker on a phone (that slightly distorted phone speaker sound)? Yeah, some. How does it compare with the other Androids that I've heard? It's louder, and less distorted. Battery life: This is my ONLY _very minor_ complaint about this phone. Not that it goes through the battery quickly, but the charging time. Actually, it takes quit a bit of hard processor work to get this battery worn out, but once you do, the battery takes a good bit to charge. This seems to be a common theme with Android phones, though. So it's not really a surprise, nor a disappointment. Would I recommend this phone if someone was considering an Android phone. Yes! A LOT! It'll fit into your back pocket, but barely. It's NOT a compact phone, but it's a slim, lightweight phone considering the size of it. I am a small woman (5'2\") with small hands and I don't find that it hinders me at all. Between the speed, the large screen size, the camera, the WiFi hotspot (ROCK!), and the speed of it, I don't know how you couldn't like it. Not to mention, with Androids, as opposed to iOS operated phones, you can upgrade the memory (relatively cheaply) and you can purchase extra batteries if you need them.",

The navigation is state of the art and is better than my 2010 mdx navi.The sound of music is great though not amazing because i am a Bose user. It came pre-installed with android 4.0 which was ok until 4.1 arrived, which I used Kies to update it.The phone made several improvements and is incredibly stable and operates fluidly. Most important to me was the user control. It allow me to have more control over my phone and change the settings. I was a former iphone 4 user and wifey has an iphone 5, so I used both phones before commenting. Now I am sold on this Galaxy s3 and overall loved this phone.",

            "body": "I traded up from a Nexus S (Android 2x, a 3g phone) which I liked just fine, when the Samsung s4 came out and the S3 became available for $10. (of course i had to commit to two more years on AT&T but I was going to continue to use them anyhow.) Needless to say the Android 4x is a huge improvement over the 2x. The phone does everything well; the only thing I would change is the size -- since I don't read books or watch movies on my phone, I prefer a slightly smaller instrument. The size of the Nexus S was perfect for me; the Samsung S3 is a bit larger and just a tiny bit less easy to hold or to slip in a pocket. But that's just a nit. Unlike the Nexus, the Samsung is loaded with junk but I don't mind; the three home screens (weird but it works) hold the icons for every app or shortcut I need, so once I set those up I basically never have to page through the app screens. And memory is no problem for my usage. I don't know why anyone would pay $200 or $250 for the S4 when the S3 is (or was, anyway) available for $10. I could afford the $250 but I just don't see why I should spend it.",

I had nothing more than a few battery issues (I was lucky to get 5 hours with moderate usage), and one day the antennas inside MELTED. I had no idea what to do, as it wouldn't connect to any cell or wifi service, so I sent it back. A few days later I checked and the status was \"SOLUTION: BER\" (Beyond Economic Repair). They claimed that it had \"excessive burning due to liquid damages,\" the liquid damages were from the melted antenna that their phone created. I called and the customer service was very unhelpful, albeit somewhat rude. I couldn't believe that I had spent $200 on a phone only to have the producer screw me over. I will now proceed to get an HTC, and never will I have a Samsung again. If you want this phone, do so at your own risk. They don't stand by their products at all.",

            "body": "I bought this phone back in July, but I wanted to give it a few months before reviewing it. As the update to Jelly Bean (Android 4.1) is now available, this is the perfect time to finally review it. To put it succinctly, I love this phone! Now, for the more detailed review. My biggest concern when I upgraded from the Samsung Captivate was the screen size. I was very happy with the Captivate's 4 inch screen and I was worried that the S3's 4.8 inch screen would be to much. This fear proved to be unfounded as the S3 is barely larger than the Captivate, the extra screen real estate being due to the smaller bezel. My mother, who has the iPhone 4, constantly mentions how much nicer my phone is than hers, because it is big enough to see stuff on. I'm also a sucker for AMOLED displays as I prefer more vibrant colors that AMOLED displays have to offer. For those of you that may have read complaints about the Pentile screen, I cannot notice any jaggedness in the images; especially with it being a high-definition screen. All-in-all, this is an excellent display. This phone is also super-fast. When I tell it to do something, it does it. My Captivate, even from the beginning, would sometimes stall on tasks. The only time the S3 ever has an lag is when I exit from the stock messaging app. Apparently, based on what I have gathered online, this is due to the stock clock widget not wanting to share RAM and then forcing a screen redraw (Although I haven't had this problem in the 1 day since I updated to Jelly Bean). Throw in AT&T's LTE service and 802.11n connectivity, and it pulls data with no delay (I've pulled down as fast as 57 Mbps in Northern Virginia) However, what I love the most about this phone is Android 4.0/4.1. It is much more polished than previous versions, with better software to boot. I recommend installing the Chrome web browser, which doesn't work in previous versions of Android, so you can sync your bookmarks between your phone and your Chrome on your computer. Samsung's improvements to the TouchWiz interface are also much appreciated. All the complaints I had about previous versions have been fixed. It supports scrollable widgets, you can display the battery icon with a percentage, it supports shortcuts and weather information on the lockscreen, and contains more useful options on the taskbar. With all that discussed, I have to mention my favorite new feature: SmartStay. Samsung added the capability that when your screen is set to turn off, the front facing camera turns on and looks to see if it can see a face. If it does, it doesn't turn off the screen. This is great for reading on, as you don't have to make sure to tap the screen every thirty seconds or so. The only negative change is that you the application launcher icon can't be moved from the lower right hand corner. I also wanted to note that the GPS is much improved from the Galaxy S1 series of phones (including my old Captivate). I've never had a problem and it has always been spot on. I did want to give a couple of final caveats to this review. First, I don't hardly use the camera. What I have used it for seems to work great, but I don't use any advanced features and can't really comment on them. Second, I'm one of the few people who seems to like TouchWiz. But if that's not your thing, there are plenty of launcher replacements available. Finally, since this is a review of a phone, I should probably mention that the call quality is good. I've not had any real problems using this as a phone. I also wanted to note one common problem that I've read about others experiencing and I experienced once. There is some problem with some phones having their clipboards corrupted. This happened to me about a month into owning the phone and I fixed it with a factory reset. So far, it hasn't happened again. I highly recommend this phone.",

            "title_review": "Best phone I've had to date (at the time of this writing of course)",
            "body": "To preface this review, I've had the following smartphones most recently in this order: iphone 3gs iphone 4 HTC inspire Samsung Galaxy s2 skyrocket Samsung Galaxy s3 PROS: - screen size and resolution. 4.8\"beast 720x1280. - Screen clarity is amazing. I can clearly read the screen in broad daylight with no strain. - Processor is blazing fast. No lag with multiple apps open and switching between them. - size, shape, and weight are all perfect for me. This phone is surprisingly thin. - speaker phone is loud and clear - cell phone reception and internet speed are exceptional - call clarity is excellent - GPS works MUCH better than the HTC inspire, and as good or better than the skyrocket - battery life is better than the HTC inspire, and about the same as the gs2 skyrocket (make sure to fully deplete the battery as soon as you get this phone. Then give it a 100% charge without taking it off the charger. Android OS needs to calibrate the battery.) - built in task manager works very well. - bottom app bar is customizable. - camera takes excellent pictures. - music player sounds great and is very responsive. - physical home button is nice to have - typing and playing games are both great experiences due to the huge, super responsive touch screen - Android 4.0.4 runs MUCH better on this device than it did on the galaxy S2 skyrocket - Shutter speed on the camera is very fast - I reliably(so-far) use the built-in clock/alarm app as my everyday wake-up alarm. The smart alarm feature is really cool too! - Comes with headphones with in-line controls. They are good for the gym, but the sound is a bit lean. CONS: - battery life still isn't as good as the iphone4. This is primarily with regards to standby time. - Touchwiz doesn't seem to have as many pretty widgets as htc sense, but I've found some 3rd party replacements (extended controls, beautiful widgets, etc) - no more touch-search-button (only menu, back, and home buttons now). I actually liked having that button. - phone is massive, so one-handed use is very difficult depending on what case you use. - S-voice is a joke, but you can use a different app... - Camera photo quality isn't quite up to par with apple's newer offerings, but is still very respectable. - Over a period of a few months, the samsung branded software keyboard will start to get VERY sluggish. I recommend downloading the stock ICS or Jellybean keyboard from the Google Market! OTHER: - I recommend the \"Llama\" app to setup cell phone tower profiles. When I enter my work's cell phone area, my phone automatically turns off wifi and gps, as well as mutes my phone. When I leave work my phone automatically turns my volume back on. When I get home I have it turn wifi on and gps off, and when I leave home it turns wifi off. VERY useful and it saves battery life. Honestly, this is the best phone I've ever used. Battery life may be a consideration for some people, but the micro USB charging port makes having (or borrowing) chargers pretty convenient. The size of the phone is awesome for me, but you may want something smaller.",

            "body": "Im only stating a few things that I noticed immediately that I have problems or success with. This phone takes really good pictures. Although it has high prose using power and ram, its about as fast as the iPhone 4. The stock keyboard does not feature auto correct. It has a correction feature but requires you to pick a word for it to change, rather than the Iphones guess feature that picks one am?and automatically applies it. You have to download the jelly bean keyboard that features full auto correct. Also to have emojis you must download an SMS app that supports the plugin. I'd rather see a software fix rather than having to download apps to make something compatible. Or you can look at it as a customizable phone. But I think people use the apps more because of the lack of standard innovation. Which brings up another point. The WiFi sucks! And has yet to be fixed. Yet again there are apps meant to fix this, but they don't work. Also the battery life. I have a refurbished s3 and its horrible. I mean dying by the end of the day horrible. I ordered a fresh battery but have yet to try it. Like any other smart phone it feels too bare by itself and just fragile. I'd recommend a case for that security and a more solid feel. Reviews never point out the user interface or tempt to explain. But its pretty self explanatory and easy to use, coming from an iPhone. Similar screens and app layout. Hooked it up to my car through a radio transmitter and the sound was really good. Oh, and if you haven't held one of these, they're BIG. I mean a little too big. Forget about typing landscape, unless you have thumb extensions. Or uh...down load a keyboard app that features a split keyboard. Even holding this phone upright you need 2 hands to touch icons in the top or bottom corner. Perhaps if you become accustomed, but to each their own. EDIT: The WiFi really is a problem. It rendered the WiFi at work useless. I got another Samsung battery online, which came halfway charged (maybe used), that's much better. Not worried about it dying.",

            "title_review": "Nice Size Screen, Snappy ICS 4.0, Great Phone",
            "body": "The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version. I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great! Here are the things I like about the phone: * The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G. * The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM. * I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.) * The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly. * It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!) * I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S. * It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc. * You can change out the battery if needed. * Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G. Now for some cons: * This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but the 4G LTE is not all in all areas so be sure to check your carrier if internet speeds is a deciding factor in purchasing this phone. If not you'll be stuck with 3G speeds. * The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time! I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad. I love this phone! :)",

            "title_review": "Great Phone but Nothing's Perfect",
            "body": "Long review so skip to the section you're most interested in if you don't feel like reading the whole thing. Physical Aspect: ================ I thought the size of the phone would bother me since it's approaching Galaxy Note size, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to handle in my hand. Granted I'm a big guy with big hands, but since I bought one for the wife as well I can tell you that she has not had a single complaint about the size. The screen size is fantastic. Even side to side next to a 4.3\" phone the difference while watching a video is pretty significant. I don't feel like I have to squint anymore to catch fine details. I kept hearing about the weight being an issue from the perspective of it being so light that it seemed insubstantial, but to me the size/weight ratio seems just right. The wife and I both have the \"marble white\" color and I must admit the contrast of the polycarbonate white shell ringed in silver is, visually, very appealing. The biggest complaint I have in this section are the buttons. For one, the home button at the bottom center is slightly raised (as opposed to all i-devices which have them sunken). This means that in some cases if you have the phone in your pocket and a piece of fabric or something else rubs up against the button it could wake the phone up while in your pocket. It will eventually sleep again, but if this happens multiple times it can affect battery life. A couple of times I've reached for it in my pocket only to discover the screen was already lit up as I took it out. My other problem is the arrangement of the power/volume buttons. I get that the \"Galaxy\" line has the volume buttons on the left side of the phone, but every other smartphone I've had from HTC to Motorola to Apple has had the volume buttons on the right so you kinda get use to that. One of the biggest annoyances about this is that if you're watching a video in landscape mode you tend to have your index finger and thumb \"framing\" the phone on top/bottom (a.k.a. left/right in landscape mode) and there is a tendency to raise or lower the volume by mistake. Which brings me to my next peeve with the buttons. A possible solution to my volume problem while watching a video is just to flip the phone 180 degrees thereby having the volume buttons on the top (while in landscape) instead of on the bottom. The problem with this is that they have decided to put the power button on the right side top part of the phone (also a Galaxy trait I believe), but then you can wind up putting the phone to sleep by inadvertently pressing it while in landscape mode. Performance: ============ I was a little upset when I found out we weren't getting the Exynos quad-core in favor of the Qualcomm dual-core. Although I haven't handled a quad-core at this point I can tell you that this dual core is VERY responsive. I haven't tasked it with much in the way of mathematical computations or heavy gaming yet, but it's handled everything I've thrown at it on a day-to-day basis without a hiccup. I've since consoled myself with the fact that while it's a dual-core, it comes with 2GB RAM while the international Exynos-chipped version comes with 1GB. I'm not sure at what point the bottle-neck of 1GB RAM gives the advantage to the slower CPU with more memory, but from what I've read the differences are not staggering. Operating System/Features: ========================== For all the rave about \"Ice-Cream-Sandwich\" (Android 4.04) I don't see the \"earth-shattering\" differences. There are improvements, no doubt, but I really only enjoy a couple of things that I didn't have before on Android 2.3.4. NFC is one. I can beam pictures to my wife's phone, but Google Wallet is useless unless you are on Sprint. I definitely like the data-usage metric, but I use to have an app for that on my previous phone, so...no biggie. I like Smart-Stay (where it watches your eyes to see if you're looking somewhere else while standing in front of the phone and turns off the screen if you're not paying attention). But this seems more like a gimmick because sometimes it doesn't detect your face and winds up shutting off the screen. As for S-Voice (the siri competitor). It's been pretty helpful for composing messages or setting calendar appointments while driving, but it doesn't know how to compose emails and it's buggy. Sometimes it understands you and sometimes it thinks your asking about stuff that's not even close to what you said. I've used siri quite a bit on several iPhones and it's not only more responsive, but has a better \"bedside manner\" when it doesn't know what the hell you're talking about. One of the things that was highly touted about Android 4.0 on the SIII (or was it the Samsung GUI that sits on top?) is that if you are texting someone, get tired of texting and want to call them instead you can just put the phone up to your ear while their text is on the screen and it will call them. I've only been able to get it to do this for me when I'm on that person's \"contact page\". I can't get it to do it while reading one of their texts. I've never been much of a photographer so for me the pictures most smartphones take are \"good enough\". To those people who are looking for all the controls and adjustments that the phone has to make them \"crisp and clear\" I say: If the pictures that you take on a daily basis are THAT important to you, you need a good $600+ Digital SLR (Nikon D5100 or Canon EOS T3 come to mind). In the case of smartphone pictures my biggest problem has always been shutter speed. I could never take a shot of my son doing something funny before he went on to something else. With the SIII though, the shutter REALLY is that fast. It is instantaneous and with the burst shot (20 pictures in quick succession) I haven't missed a shot yet. this aspect of the SIII is awesome. I especially like the \"Best Shot\" feature. During family cookouts now I don't have to ask 12 people to just stand there and smile for 45 seconds while I take a picture and check it to make sure everyone's eyes were open before I let them all go their separate ways. I can just press the button, the phone takes 8 pictures in rapid succession, analyzes them and offers me the best shot where everyone is smiling and looking this way. I can disband the \"Fellowship-of-the-ring\" before I look to see if I got a good shot, because I usually will get at least one out of the 8. Hands down I think my favorite feature on the SIII is the facial recognition security. I like to secure my phone, but I hate jumping through the \"enter pin\" or \"connect the dots\" hoops to unlock it. The facial recognition just works (in good light) and I set the pin method as a backup in case it can't see me or doesn't recognize me. I love it. I do hate, however, the music player that comes with the phone. It's very simplistic and I prefer the sweeping carousel of cover art prevalent on i-devices. Although the speaker volume is loud enough to play music without earphones, unlike on my first-gen iPhone. Data/Call quality (Carrier: T-mobile): ====================================== The T-mobile version seems to be the red-headed stepchild of the different versions because it's the only one that will not support LTE 4G when it does roll out on T-mobile. The up-front costs are also a little higher. The reason I chose it was because I did some research on Root Metrics ([...]) and found that although T-Mobile is the smallest of the nationwide carriers (by subscribers) they have been quietly upgrading their data network. It's HSPA+ so it's not truly \"4G\", but frankly, what I care about is data throughput, and 4G data doesn't carry a special badge that says it's 4G so who cares what network it's on, as long as it's fast. Thus far, I average between 8-15Mbps downstream and between 1.2 and 3.3Mbps upstream on 4G in most areas around Miami. That's on the order of several times faster than the DSL I had coming into my home till a few weeks ago when I switched to Comcast. The fact that T-mobile is last among the major carriers means that they offer great prices. I know Verizon is considered the fastest in data, but at the end of the day, how much better quality can an HD video get from watching it on 15Mbps connection than on a 22Mbps connection? 1080p requires between 8-10Mbps so it's like shooting a chicken with a bazooka. As for the phone not supporting LTE...The way I figure it by the time LTE is as ubiquitous as 3G is today this phone will be obsolete and I'll be on to the next greatest thing...so who cares that I won't be able to use it with the technology of 5 years from now? If Google glass is any indication by that time we'll be wearing our wireless devices instead of carrying them around in our pockets. Lastly, T-mobile's data plan is 2GB of 4G data per device versus Verizon's \"share everything among all your devices\" plan. And you don't incur overages because once you go over your 2GB limit they slow you down, but you still get data and no additional fees. Oh and call quality is quite good also...but who uses phones to make calls now-a-days anymore? Pfft!",

Android is very customizable, I'm using the nova launcher and will try another rom soon. 2. Power button placement is perfect, so you can easily turn it on or off, unlike the htc one x. Volume button placement is good, and is on the left side like the iPhone, unlike what one confused reviewer was complaining about. Plus, the home button can wake the device, unlike the htc one x. 3. Great battery life with power saving mode on. And you can surf the net with inverted (black and white) on the stock browser, which just about doubles browsing time for me (iPhone can invert, but the lcd screen didn't save battery like an amoled does on black pages). 4. Plastic feels fine in the hand, don't know why ppl complain. I use a case most of the time anyway. 5. Speaker is loud. 6. Has dedicated notification leds, unlike the iPhone. The htc one x leds are barely visible under the speaker grill. Cons: 1. IPhone has more apps. 2. IPhone headset has better bass.",

Pros: Beautiful, slim design that feels just right in the hand (definitely does not look nor feel cheap as some claim, imho). Fast, lag-free, and fluid. Amazing battery life (easily lasts a full day's usage with 7hours+ screen time). LTE is just awesome. Extremely responsive and fast (59ms ping, 56943 kbps down, 15153 kbps up just the other day). Cons: S-Voice is rather silly. I spend way too much time playing with this phone.",

            "body": "UPDATE: Increased my rating a bit, because they did finally make everything right after about a half month of dealing with it. Att is great, the phone is great, and this is the only problem I have had with amazon. I am a long time user and owner of an s3 I bought at best buy. I got to see the phone etc worked out great. Phone came with the glass pulling away from one corner (very hard to tell) and of course I missed it until after the phone was activated. Now, since they sold out, I am stuck jumping through hoops hoping I dont have to shell out $200+ for a new screen. Even if they did have it i would be stuck floating $500. So buyer beware, terrible way to buy a phone and probably worth the extra money to go somewhere physical. If you get a good one the phone itself is awesome.",

            "body": "Earlier this year I slipped off to Evo-land and had a great experience with the HTC Evo One X, but at the end of the day, AT&T's version of the One X was too limited: smaller space (16GB instead of 32), no added storage, sealed battery, too much pre-loaded junk, too much data-gobbling. I wasn't ready to live that much in the cloud. Thus far, the Galaxy S III has been the answer to all of my problems. It has none of the senility of my Galaxy I (which got really weird there at the end), it is far snappier than the Galaxy II I played with, and the Android 4.0 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" OS has me giddy with its response time and smooth transition from one program to another. Yes, the Galaxy S III really can multi-task, and is happy to do so. Best of all, I slipped in my 32GB SD Card and we were ready to go. The HTC One X consumed just over 6GB of its built-in 16GB. This means an AT&T Evo One X has only 9 GB of room. Out of the box, the Galaxy S III takes up a little over 4GB of the native 16, but will allow you to slot in an SD card of up to 64GB in size for even more room. If the battery stops holding a charge one day, I'll just open the case, pop it out, and put in a new one--how handy! I've seen some people have battery problems, but so far I've managed to go up to two days without having to charge. It all depends on what I'm doing, but even with what I consider to be heavy activity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, several calls, lots of surfing), I don't have to charge the phone more than once a day. INTERFACE AND SETTINGS With the Galaxy S III's interface, there are a LOT of options that let you customize your phone to be just as you want it: it's as if the makers of both the Galaxy III and the Droid OS decided to bend over backwards and hand you the keys to pretty much every feature you can think of. For example, if you hate eating data when someone e-mails you an attachment, you can set the phone to only pull down attachments when on Wi-Fi, or not at all. Check for new messages anywhere from 'continuous' to 'daily' to 'never' (which means 'manually'). Hotmail works much better now that Exchange is supported--my Galaxy I would take forever, drop out, freeze, or give me nagging, 'Too many requests' messages. Getting around is smooth swiping with the Gorilla Glass on the Galaxy S III's face, but I still went with a so-so Steinheil screen protector. Either way, SWYPEing is easier: not only is the onscreen keyboard huge, with the keys generously spaced wherever possible, but the SWYPE interface draws your swipe line cleanly and it is easy to see what word you are SWYPEing. Word suggest is still annoying--tap out the word \"text\" and get \"Texas\" inserted--but once I turned this off, everything else worked well. If there's one disadvantage to the Galaxy S III, it's that both the phone and the screen are a real fingerprint magnet: the Evo X picks up stains and smudges, but was just a bit better about not getting as much smeariness on the glass. Still, with either device the problem is solved by a quick swipe across your shirt. APPS AND WIDGETS Android phones now use the Google Play Store instead of the Droid Market and it works fairly well: enter your Google account info and you're ready to go. AT&T customers still get CRapplications they can't remove, but your own third-party apps can also be side-loaded after changing one setting in the options. You can't root the phone (yet, anyway), but I'm not seeing the horrible performance drag of all that AT&T stuff like I used to. I'm especially fond of the side-loaded Amazon App Store, which nimbly pushed all my apps down with no complaints, security warnings, or performance drops (take that, ol' Galaxy I!) Applications now come in two form factors: Apps and Widgets. When you tap the 'Applications' button from the home screen, the resulting screens are tabbed between a list of Applications and a list of Widgets. Think of an 'App' as meaning \"An icon I tap to launch a program\" and a 'Widget' as \"A thing I may launch, or may just interact with at the screen and never need to open separately\" (like the Weather, the media player, or the flashlight). When you swipe from one home screen to another, adding Widgets now gets a Windows Phone like twist: some widgets are double-wide like a Windows Phone 7 tile, and some (like the media player or the clock/weather on the main home screen) take up half the screen--the variety of sizes also resembles the coming Windows 8 Metro interface. Instead of feeling crowded, it reminds me of how much fun it was to play with my first desktop gadgets in Windows Vista. NETWORKING AND DATA Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are very responsive: connecting to various networks or pairing is quick. If you connect to the type of network that requires you to open a browser and agree to something/provide a user ID before you can connect, the Galaxy S III will prompt you accordingly and automatically open the page you need. There is also a button right on the pull-down menu to turn off packet data so you can conserve your data plan--I like that feature VERY much. MULTIMEDIA Multimedia playback is excellent: while my Galaxy I would take quite a while to open and respond to me, the Media Player Widget makes my music quickly accessible. True to form, I get album art, artist/title/album searches, and a very good quality of playback over the included earbuds. CAMERA The Galaxy S III has two cameras: one in the front and a much better one in the back. Both are for taking photos and shooting video. The camera on the back is for the serious picture-taking and has a very high-output flash for such a tiny LED. Picture-taking is so fast I find myself accidentally snapping multiple shots! The gallery of my Galaxy S I might take a while to show me newly-snapped photos, but with the S III they are not only instantly available, I can go straight into the Gallery from the Camera and not have to step out to the home screen. Flash can be adjusted on and off, switching cameras is as easy as tapping one icon, and there are a variety of easy-to-access options, from three focus modes (Auto, Macro, Face detection) to generic 'shooting mode' settings: Single shot, burst, HDR, \"Smile Shot\", Beauty, Panorama, Share Shot, and Buddy photo share. Settings includes the ability to adjust the exposure value, and what's more there are scene modes for sports, night, party/indoor, etc. CALLS The feel of the Contacts and Phone Dialing interface haven't changed much, but the look certainly has: icons, contact pictures, and menus are larger on the Galaxy III's generous screen. I found myself making fewer mistakes trying to nudge and poke my way through the touchscreen when I needed to look up a contact or merge their information. Call quality is excellent, and answering the phone is easy. As with all new phones, there are many ringtones, alarms, and message sounds to choose from: I was very pleased with the variety of options this time around--the many sounds you can choose from for your calls range from soothing and tranquil to jarring and noisy. If you're looking for a new Android Smartphone, the Galaxy S III is a fantastic choice. Its screen is bright, colorful and generous, the OS runs smooth and fast and the screen is very responsive to touch. The number of features at times seems endless, but more importantly, Samsung have executed those features well: this is indeed a great phone.",

On phone, all associates and managers are unfriendly, unprofessional, and very cunning to cut off the conversation. Samsung Galaxy S3 phone is not reliable.

            "body": "I bought this over an htc evo 4g because the battery is 2100 mah instead of 1400 or 1600 or whatever the evo's is. For the size of the battery the life is horrendous. I'm lucky if i get 14 hours on standbye, i get maybe 4-6 with moderate to heavy use. Even with power saving mode enabled and most features turned off you can forget about it lasting all day and not dying at night. And this is after getting a task manager to kill a runaway process gsiff.daemon that eats 70-80 percent of my cpu everytime the phone \"hot boots\" which happens way to frequently whilst the phone isn't being used in my pocket. If i don't realize this has happened it will die within an hour as well as getting incredibly hot. Returned it once 2nd phone had same problems. Bought a new battery (4400 mah almost the same capacity as my laptop) which is huge and clunky and completely ruins the phones aesthetic appeal. Even with this I am unable to get the same standbye time as a 4 year old iphone whos battery has degraded to roughly 850 mah. Called samsung and all they would say is sorry. The customer service rep couldn't even tell me how long it should last on standbye. What did you idiots never even test it?! worth 79 bucks as an upgrade? Sure, but don't think for a second the significantly larger than average battery is a buying point. With heavy use you can get better battery life out of a 15 inch laptop. Frankly I'm pissed. My friend has the Verizon variant and has the same exact problem.",

            "body": "(Network AT&T - US Version via Amazonwireless.com) I purchased this phone for my wife to replace her beat up Motorolo Razr Flip phone. This was her first smartphone and I was a little afraid she would have a hard time using it. I tested the phone before she got home from work and there were many bells and whistles that are very cool and innovative, which made me worried it would overwhelm a simple user like my wife. After my wife played around with the phone for couple of days, she loves the phone and has started customizing the phone the way she likes it. I myself own a Samsung Galaxy S Captivate, and have been pretty happy with the phone until now because of the SIII. I am so impressed with the phone, that I will be purchasing one for myself. Pros: - Screen: Some say iPhone's Retina Display is better, but I am convinced it is just personal preference. If you like images and the screen to pop out and be lively, Samsung's AMOLED screen is the way to go. If you like softer tones, you may enjoy the iPhone. I personally like the crisp and sharp contrast of the AMOLED screens. Also the screen is pretty large which to me is a plus. - Battery: I have not benchmarked the battery, so this is not a technical comparison, but since we just got this phone, my wife and I have been using the phone pretty much non-stop and the battery lasts the whole day. I have not seen the battery level go down below 50%. - Weight: The phone feels really light holding on to it. - Performance: The phone runs smooth. I'm very impressed how fast the phone downloads files and streams vidoes over AT&T's 4G LTE network (Orange County, CA). I really can't tell the difference between the mobile data speeed with my home's Cable Modem using a Wireless N+ router. It's pretty fast. - Camera: the rear facing camera takes pretty sharp pictures and videos. Neutral - I've read some complaints about the casing feeling cheap. I honestly don't get that. I thought it feels nice and makes the phoen lighter. I didn't know people liked heavy phones so much. - Over heating? I kid you not, we are constantly using this phone. I personally was using the phone for about an hour straight and didn't feel any uncomfortable heat. My Captivate however feels like it's going to melt. And I've played around with iPhone's. Those get pretty hot also. - NFC. I think this will only be useful when it becomes more commonplace. For now, it feels gimmicky. Cons: - The pen that Samsung makes for this is pretty pricey (for a pen). - S-Voice. Kind of gimmicky. I don't like Siri to start with, but S-Voice is even more useless. - S-Suggest. You can disable it, but still find it useless. Overall, I'm very happy with the phone, and happy that my wife is using it, and having fun with it! I'm planning on getting the blue one soon.",

Charge - After 2 weeks, when charging, the phone gets to hot to hold! I took it out of the case, still gets really hot Charge - after 2 weeks, charges sloooooooooooooowwwww Calls - After 2 weeks, when I get a call, it has this neat feature where you can ignore the call and it sends a text \"in a meeting\" \" Call you back in a minute\" or some such. The problem is that now it gives me those options and NO OPTION IF I WANT TO ANSWER THE CALL????? 4G I was in Downtown Atlanta, I should get GREAT 4G, nothing not even 3G nothing Internet - loses internet when I am at home, with wireless Contacts - I have to search all contacts, pick the name, pick the phone number, press call then pick which number they are both the same number but for some reason the phone saved the number twice, once with a \"1\" in front of it. You can't just press call, it is a royal pain to make a damn phone call! Contacts - the names have all disappeared and now only the phone numbers are showing. Phone calls - it takes several minutes for the touch screen to respond and by then, the caller has hung up Phone service - sitting in my office, suddenly my phone says \"no service\" In a town where there should be plenty of phone signals. I have NEVER had a phone tell me that at work. I hate this phone and thought, maybe I got a lemon, they make lots of these so that is possible but if you go on the web and google this phone, the reviews are AWFUL! Do NOT get it! I hate it!",

My old Droid X would allow the call to ring through the bluetooth seemlessly. It also does not show the phone on my navigation screen so I have to manually start and end a call from the phone. I contacted Samsung today and they said that's just how it works. I would have expected a new phone to be more compatible with hands-free devices than less. The phone also seems to hang up when typing to accessing web pages more than my old phone. The camera isn't very good either. I had a hard time getting a clear picture even for stills.

I personally thought the htc one x looked and felt way better. I really wanted to get the htc one x but I had a real issue with the way htc one x handles multitasking. It kills and reloads apps and doesnt seem to be true android multitasking so thats why I got the galaxy s3. I figured the s3 doesnt do this because it has so much extra ram. My problem with the galaxy s3 is the screen. It is soooooo dim.. and looks like crap honestly. The maximum brightness is soooo low. Obviously if the maximum brightness possible is way too low the auto-brightness feature is going to be completely useless which it is. Now I compared the screen of the htc one x to that of the s3, and the one x screen is WAY WAY WAY better than the s3. The colors are way more accurate, and brightness goes up really high. The htc one x screen is simply the best screen I have ever seen on a phone. It's ridiculouly better than the s3. That said, everythign else about the s3 is perfect. ill be keeping it but i dont really understand why samsung woudl reduce the maximum brightness possible on a phone just to save battery life. Let the user turn down the brightness. Now if i want to turn up the max brightness to watch a show or something on my phone, i cant. Darkish shows and movies are unwatchable on the s3 because all the dark colors blend together to form black. None of the colors are accurate. The screen is terrible. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ROCKS",

            "title_review": "Screen Breaks by itself; Samsung does not acknowledge the issue",
            "body": "I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S III on November 4, 2012. On November 15, 2012, I placed a 15 minute phone call. Please note that I am very careful with my device. It has had a Seidio cover on it since purchase, and I am very careful with it. The phone has never been dropped. After the 15 minute phone call, I set the device on the coffee table. I noticed what appeared to be a hair on the screen. Upon further investigation, it was not a hair, but a cracked screen. I was very upset because I had not dropped the phone or caused any pressure or dropped anything on the screen to cause the damage. My first action was to visit the AT&T Wireless authorized retailer closest to me. They advised me that I would have to go to Costco, where they might be able to further help me.I went to Costco, and they said they would be unable to refund me my money because it was a damaged phone, and I would have to go through Samsung directly.I called Samsung directly and they told me that all they would be able to do is repair the screen for a charge of $178.50. I spoke to a regular call center employee and then a supervisor, who acknowledged that the crack could have been due to the device overheating and a defect, but he could not do anything but repair the screen. He did not acknowledge that the phone overheating was no fault of mine, but the manufacturers directly and was very unhelpful. I would expect that a company as large as Samsung would stand behind their product. If you google \"Samsung Galaxy III screens cracking on their own,\" you will find hundreds of stories exactly like mine, so I believe that this cracking of the screen is a widespread issue that Samsung has yet to address.",

            "title_review": "HD AMOLED is a major deal braker",
            "body": "I picked it up from major electronics chain, an impulse decision but I didn't have any doubts concidering how much praises I read abot this phone. Basically on paper it seemed to have everything that main competitor was missing, a great big screen, robust and responsive performance, and previously only having used Gingerbread devices, the ICS and upcoming Jelly Bean update were obviously a gigantic leap for Android. Imidiately taking advantage of Google Play market, I started loading it with apps, and coming from the \"evil\" side I was surprised that you can actually get malware on Android, but than I started receiving annoying ads in notification bar. I tried all major anti virus apps, and the 5th or 6th Malware detector, was finally able to detect the pesky source of ads. Returning to actual phone usage, battery life was never a concern, as I was planning of getting additional batteries, overall it has outstanding battery life and with a few tweaks no additional batteries are even needed as it makes through 9-5 like any other phone. Coming from iphone 3gs, camera alone seemed like a killer feature. I have a descent Nikon DSLR, but the photos looked stunning, not really pro grade of course, but with some basic editing more than sufficient for cool daily shots. The screen I figured would resolve the size constraint of a 3.5 inch I had before, and just seemed more natural and even enough to replace a tablet, escpecially with capability of loading entire movie collection 64gb card and take it on a long trip or etc, to preserve the valuable gigabytes that come with a data plan. The downside the screen itself looked unnatural, striking reds, that I had to hide the red Contacts icon. The buttom line, to decrease the battery consumption, Samsung had to compromise the screen quality, dimming down the screen, and boosting color temperature. The result, the whites are not as white as lcd, colors looks oversaturated, but blacks are very dark, so videos look great, but some apps especially using same apps on ipad, appear to have weird tones to them. For the web surfing and reading text I would prefer colder tones. To make things even worse, I started to experience eye strain after 10-15 minutes of usage. It went away, after continual usage, so I could use it for 3 hours and be ok, but only feeling the pressure in my eyes after using this phone. I though it was all part of adaptation process to HD Amoled, but it was getting worse and even persisted when I wasn't looking directly at the screen, as I was driving and using it as Gps. Still once it was off, I imidiately felt a relief in my eyes. I was trying to replicate this uncomfortable sensation in my eyes by staring at other screens at full brightness, but no discomfort whatsoever, Googling for this confirmed my suspicion that it was something wrong with the screen, as other users had similar symptoms when using S3. I also stumbled upon one youtube video compating iphone and s3. The video was taken in low light settings, and S3 screen was flickering, while iPhone was static. Its was like almost like reliving the 90s, where flickering screens were all so common with crt monitors and tvs. That is also time when we installed protective screens on monitors, to decrease the tiny amounts of radiation emmited by screens. So to prove my theory I returned the phone and got another one, and the eye strain was practically gone the next day. to sum it up, I don't care how many more patents Samsung needs to infringe, but I am not buying another Samsung or HD Amoled phone untill they come up with better screens. Please do your homework before buying, and obviously in its ambition to beat Apple in numbers, Samsung has chosen to use inferior screen technology called Pentile. Please don't gamble with your eye sight by trying to save a few dollars, and obviously now with recent price reduction this phone has entered a bargain phone segment.",

If I get international missed calls and I call back using the same missed call log, it doesn't work. I have to search in the contact and make a call. Some angels complained about me posting my bad experience here, looks like first amendment has been buried. Amazon ordering application has a bug: I had a very bad experience with my Amazon wireless purchase. Here is sequence of events. 1. 11/23/2012 I bought two \"Samsung Galaxy 3\" with 2 years contract with Sprint. 2. I wanted my old number ported for one phone and a new phone number for another one. 3. I got two phones, new phone number and activation instructions on 11/28 4. I decided to return phones and not activate sprint contract because of CDMA phones 5. I returned phones on 12/01 and did not activate my account with sprint 6. Amazon still went ahead and asked Sprint to port my old number (from T-mobile) 7. I lost my T-mobile service 12/8. This is when problems started for me. When I asked T-mobile to re-activate my service, they said it would be a new 24 month contract, which I didn't want to do. 8. I had to buy another phone, so I decided to buy same two (Samsung Galaxy 3) with two years contract with AT&T. I ordered on 12/8, but the web application didn't allow me to keep my old number. When I talked to Amazon customer service, I was told during activation time I can ask AT&T if they can port my old number from sprint. 9. On 12/12 AT&T agreed to port my number from Sprint and discarded new phone numbers given by Amazon. It took 90 minutes on the phone call with AT&T and Sprint guys to resolve all issues. 10. On 12/19 I get a mail from stupid Amazon that My AT&T service has been disconnected and my credit card will be charged $500.00 (discount given to phones for 2 yrs contract). 11. on 12/21 I called Amazon, AT&T to resolve the issue, not charge $500.00..I am not still optimistic about this. Be careful when buying from Amazon..",

I know Samsung it a awesome product and it show in their line of products like their True LED televisions, but when I hold the Galaxy 3 on my hands I just can't believe how cheap it feels and so plastickly.

Also the build quality feels a bit flimsy and cheap due to its plastic body. When comparing build quality to an iphone or htc one series this phone just feels flat out cheap. On another note, performance is just flat out amazing, but not that much better then a phone like the htc one x. Also when comparing the camera to phones like the one x, and iphone 4s, i would say it is better then the iphone, but slightly losses out to the htc. When testing out the UI i have to say it is probably the best non-vanilla version of android since it doesn't have a lot of bloat ware like htc sense. And last but not least, i think the screen is great but it depends on personal preference, the gsIII super amoled gives nice rich colors, but can be a little over exaggerated, as where the iphone and one x will give you more natural colors( pixel density is basically the same on all these phones so not really a factor, except gsIII share sub pixels, where the iphone and htc dont share but its still a tie in my opinion).",

            "body": "Upgrading from my older, very reliable and functional Nokia 900 Windows Phone to my new Nokia 1520 Windows Phone is all good! The six-inch screen is much sharper with better resolution, and provides easier to read text and webpages on the larger screen. The faster processor (quad-core) and more memory provides much better performance for all functions and features. The 1520 is about the size as a desktop phone handset to hold and use for phone calls, so for me the larger size phone is not a problem and audio call quality is excellent. I chose a horizontal belt-loop carry case to carry it around, and that works for me. Battery capacity is good for my typical all-day use, and data-intensive activities seem to be the biggest battery drain. After an overnight recharge, its ready for another business day. I'm still discovering the newest features and functions. So far, the Cortana voice-assist has worked very well, and voice recognition (of my voice) and the Cortana answers have been spot-on and quick. I do most of my business work on a laptop, but this 1520 is serving as an excellent device for a mobile extension to my office. I haven't tried Skype yet, but the Lumia Cameras (both selfie and front-facing) are excellent and produce very high quality images (20 MP front-facing). Since the phone purchase, I received and applied one Windows 8.1 Update via AT&T (downloaded using WiFi connection) that was uneventful, auto-restarted three times (included both firmware and OS upgrades) during the upgrade process, and resulted in better performance on all levels. Almost a replacement for a laptop - getting closer anyway.",

            "body": "My 5th Windows phone since switching from iPhone 4s. Software as usual was excellent... Very stable and reliable with all the normal functions I use every day working flawlessly, intuitively and quickly. Biggest use of my phone is at work where I rely on Onenote, Word, Excel, Xbox Music and Audible to get me through my day. On the hardware side Nokia gets it right again... With a high end processor the speed never fails to impress the screen is a joy to look at and the super sensitive touch works perfectly while riding my dirt bikes with gloves. Additionally the phone is pretty thin, takes abuse (though I have a case) and has second to none battery life (Literally: http://wmpoweruser.com/nokia-lumia-1520-demonstrates-amazing-battery-life-in-gsmarena-test/). Only downside I can think of is occasional mis-calibration of the display brightness when set to auto (comes up way too dim) but always corrects its self within 10 seconds and occurs pretty infrequently when you unlock the phone... Basically a non issue. As far as apps go I have everything I want though I am not a huge mobile gamer so I can comment on that but my phone currently has 325 apps on it about 80-100 of which get used once a week or more and includes all the big name apps (most of which were missing when I first got my phone. As few frequently used common sample: Facebook Facebook page manager (full feature client for managing pages like businesses, events and causes) Chase bank Etrade financial Youtube (though I normally use one of the many excellent third party clients since the 1st party app isn't as good) Unit converter Flashlight Amazon Audible Netflix WPtorrentpro (bit torrent client) Dominoes Pizza Maaloo Outdoors (a outdoor mapping and tracking client that allows saving of track including import and export with dropbox and skydrive support... Great for ATV/Dirt biking, hiking, etc)",

I've had the 920 and the 925 recently, and I was expecting this phone to be at least on par with the other two but I was not expecting it to be leaps and bounds ahead. It exactly that however. Visually, the device is similar to the 920 in design. Larger, thinner, and far more powerful. For those who are appcentric, make certain that apps you use everyday are on this platform before you switch. Once you've decided that excellent telephony trumps apps, it's a no brainer. The 1520 brings top of the line specs to the table whether you're looking for resolution, screen size, expandability, performance, or longevity. It's all here. My average battery life is 32 hours. the downside is the dialer, it's massive and often requires two hands to dial. The work around is to use live tiles, or to use bluetooth or voice control dialing which is superb.",

I would like to see a monster update for these devices, to try and revive the market.

It fits fine in a jacket pocket but not so much in a pants pocket. The larger display is great and the battery lasts for several days. The Windows 8 display and navigation takes awhile to get used to. I have Windows 8 on my touch-screen PC and almost never use it as the Windows 7 format works fine. Now that I appreciate the advances in Windows Phone 8, maybe I'll use Windows 8 (PC version) more. Setting up the synchronizing of email was easy, but syncing the calendar and contacts took quite an effort. The Microsoft, AT&T, and Nokia web sites have instructions for syncing, but it is not clear which software and platforms are used in each process. My Windows 8 PC runs both Outlook mail and Windows mail. Google hosts my mail. AT&T provides the communications service. Nokia also has some server processes. I ended up with multiple email accounts, contact lists, and calendars on my PC before getting the right combination on the phone. Downloading apps is easy and fast from the MIcrosoft Store. Initially I was concerned that a couple of my old favorites were not programmed for Windows Phone, but most others are now available. The apps start up and run fast, and the display makes them easier to use.",

            "body": "I purchased this phone from a third party Amazon retailer as used. The retailer was honest about the phone and described what was good about it and what was not so good about it. I purchased a replacement rear camera lens that was previously broken and identified by the seller. The phone worked flawlessly. I was able to upgrade the phone to a newer version of Windows Phone and am very happy with it. I have owned this Nokia Lumina 1520 for several months now and like everything about it that it is NOT. Mainly it is NOT an Apple iPhone which is what this Nokia Replaced, and yes, I just slid my AT&T sim card out of my iPhone and into the Nokia. Works perfectly and was able to move my contacts easily from my old phone to this one. The Nokia 1520 is a big phone, more like a phablet than a phone. This smartphone is not for everyone's taste as it is large, somewhat cumbersome, but takes awesome pictures and video. I feel more comfortable with the Windows interface rather than Apple. Apple makes a great phone but I really got tired of the hype and how much I needed the bleeding edge of their technology, so I got off the train and went to Nokia. Now that Nokia has sold their phone business to Microsoft, I may have a different opinion with the next generation of Surface Phone or whatever they are going to call it. I may keep what I have for a few more years and not upgrade at all, I am that happy with it now.",

I like the Windows live tile design, and once you get familiar with how to get around in the OS, it's as good as anything else out there. Camera takes sharp, color-correct pictures. Low-light is good. Close-ups are very good. The cool thing is the very tight integration with the Windows operating system which makes sharing, viewing and editing files between computer and phone very easy. The app store does not have as wide a selection as Apple or Android, but most of the popular ones are there, and there is almost always an app that will do the job. Battery life is good. I can usually go about a day and a half before it needs a charge, but I'll typically charge it at night, so it's very rare that I run out of power. The speakers are pretty powerful on this phone, so you can really crank up the music if you want.",

It still fits in my work pants (khakis in an IT office). The phone is wider and taller than everything else. It is a mini-tablet in every respect. That is not to say that this screen is bad. It is a beautiful screen, perfect for watching movies. The Clear Black technology is great and is easy to read outdoors. I recently upgraded to Windows Phone 8.1 Developer Preview without a hitch. This update makes Windows Phone even better than it already was. This a great phone, if you have big hands, are over 6 feet tall, and/or are looking for a Windows Phone \"phablet\". PS: I am primarily and Android user, who used to be primarily an iOS user. I have multiple phone lines, which include an iPhone, a HTC One, and this Nokia. I occasionally buy phones such off contract, such as my Nexus 5 and the Nokia 520.",

            "body": "I wanted to come on here and add to the reviews, lol with all the buzz around the iPhone 6 now. I have had my Lumia 1520 since last December and I absolutely love it! I loved it before the recent Windows Phone 8.1 upgrade and now, after that, I love it waaay more! It's almost like a new phone but within the same hardware. Upgraded interface! On to the review - I'm not much of a techie so I'm not going to list a review of every feature. Of course the camera is great and really everything else. I will go through some things I really love about it. Cortana is really awesome. I don't think it is operating yet at full capacity- meaning I don't think I've untapped all of its capabilities yet, but it is really cool. It doesn't talk to me as much as I would like but that's probably because I don't really talk to it - I still feel a little weird talking to my phone! I didn't go through the whole Siri thing, as I never liked the iPhone interface. Back to the phone & Cortana: I love the daily snapshot it gives me - tailored to me from all the things I told it. I love the reminders it gives me - telling me that its time to leave and the traffic, to get to an appointment. Its really helpful. I love the slide down notifications and expanded volume control. I love the new texting style - makes typing a lot of words possible in a really short time! and is so effortless! I love the new update to the already cool live tiles! The transparent background is awesome! I love the new glance screen - the update is just that much cleaner! And of course I've always loved the overall look - both the build of the phone and the interface. I appreciate the interface over a Droid or iPhone interface any day, and furthermore don't get how soooo many people aren't turned on to Window Phone's interface instead! I think Microsoft needs to do better advertising! Maybe stop showing Windows Phones in comparison to Apple. I mean that's great and all - people need to see a comparison but a lot of the earlier ads - that kind of comparison just makes it seem like you're constantly showing Apple as the standard that you're trying to catch up to (standard in popularity of course) but they need to show how Windows Phone stands in its own class! Lastly I really hope they continue to improve the phone. If they continue to make jumps like they did with this WP8 to WP8.1 - they will be lightyears ahead of the competition!!",

            "body": "I love this phone I've had it since day one. My last one dropped and cracked a few days ago, so I purchased a refurb phone and restored from the back up (one drive) took 20 mins and it's like I never left. I love the Screen size first 6 inch phone, the color is wonderful and visible in direct light. The camera is a must have 20mpx makes this thing glimmer compared to other high end smart phone cameras. Built in NFC and Wireless charging is great (Non At&t model they remove that) (don't recommend the charging case it has no protection and is the reason my last one is dead). The WiFi support AC making this phone fly when connected to a good home network. Windows 10 loads well but heats the phone up and kills battery lift (went back to 8.1 update 3 denim). There are a lot of apps for this phone and using it with Office is great! Hook this phone up to a wireless display using Miracast (no lag) hook in a keyboard Bluetooth and mouse and you have a nice mini PC. I can not say enough good about this phone, wish the corners were not so pointy but other wise great look feel and design. All Windows phone should be like this one.",

And the 1520 is exactly that! I'm supper satisfied with my purchase from the gizmo trade. Everything works and runs super smooth. I had to cut my sim card to size cause the 1520 takes a Nano sim. And thankfully it worked. Wouldn't recommend everyone to that. I even updated it to windows 10 and it got even better! Shipping was super quick. I ordered on a Friday at 5:00pm and was delivered by the following Monday at 2:00 pm. No bull this phone is humangus!",

            "body": "Okay, so I bought this phone to replace my iPhone 5. I was an avid iPhone user, but I decided it was time to try something new. This phone out performs my old iPhone in every way! The only down fall is that yes, the app store is somewhat limited, but its okay, because the great increase in screen size allows me to do more on the web! There is a bit of a learning curve, but it is easy to use once you found it out. Now, as a testament as to how durable the phone is! The fourth day I had the phone, I dropped it out of my car and accidentally kicked it into the snow bank. I didn't realize it at the time and the phone spent 13 hours in a pile of snow. It literally was encased in ice, but after thawing it out for about an hour, I was able to resume my angry birds game where I had left off. The ice seems to have had no effect what so ever. Not even a scratch. This phone is a tank! I didn't even have a case on it!!!",

This is a screen that you can get some serious consumption done. Windows phone operating system is the best in the market place, modern sleek, information driven--and just down right cool! The apps, can not think of anything I want to do where there isn't a very good app that lets me do it. Fast-wow, is this thing fast, external storage add 64gig with an sd card, sound, loud and full. The camera--wow, nothing on the market beats it except for the lumia 1020. Except for the herd mentality of the American market place, this phone would be on every top seller list!

The operating system is exemplary and contains numerous refinements that are simply outstanding. There is a sensing function that detects the amount of ambient light, and it adjusts the color scheme of the display to ensure maximum readability. I am very impressed with this. The call quality is a little muddy when using the speakerphone function. But it isn't bad enough to take a star off. (I'm not convinced the sometimes-muddy quality is caused by the phone exclusively.) I would say that the overall call quality is good, but not pristine. The expandable memory is a plus. I've taken some unwarranted flack about the Lumia 1520's Windows operating system. This is by far the best mobile operating system available. To my personal perspective, Apple's OS is for simple people. Android is very good, but I have had one android device fail inexplicably. But this Windows OS does things that I truly appreciate. I liken my transition from android to windows to driving an old Jeep, and then upgrading to a Mercedes S-500. Simply put, it is just better.",

That said, it is a pretty awesome device. * The screen is truly amazing. It is clear, crisp and responsive and an absolute joy to work on. But at full brightness, it does suck the battery pretty fast. * The Windows Phone 8 OS is coming along nicely and although you will miss some apps (waiting impatiently for FlipBoard) I have found that it addresses all my day to day needs. (see notes below) * Speed is awesome and games like Asphalt 8 runs brilliantly. * The ATT version only has 16GB of Memory for Apps and no wireless charger. (Thanks for that). But not the phones fault. * I added a 32GB micro SD Card for extra media. * The camera is awesome. 20MP is more than enough for most users. * Browsing the web on this device is pretty good. The big screen helps So, Windows Phone 8. The OS got a bad wrap and although there are still some major issues / missing features it is definitely getting better. The user experience is great and fresh when compared to iOS that despite it's makeover, is pretty stale. Things that I miss are: * VPN support (coming) * Notification center (coming) .... not much else The app gap is closing fast and if Microsoft does go in the direction that some media outlets are reporting (dropping royalty fees for Windows Phone [unconfirmed]) we should hopefully see an explosion of devices to challenge android. Since the OS will only get better, I'm happy with my purchase.",

No drops, no water boarding, no opening of the phone. To repair - it meant replacing the entire motherboard - about 1/2 the price of the phone. Was ***great*** while it worked - very good camera, really good screen and surprisingly good battery life (2-3 days on a full charge). Still using it on Wi-Fi only as a tablet - was too big as a day to day phone anyway. Disclaimer: I was a Nokia Lumia fan (900, 950, 1020, 1520) and now moved to Microsoft mid level line (650) - that inherited the hardware and all the good software from Nokia.",

            "body": "This is my second Nokia 1520. The first one had its issues but this second one infuriates me. The hardware is fantastic. The phone is fast, the screen is very large and looks great, the camera takes good pictures and video, the processor is fast, etc. However the software is terrible. The interface is great, much better then IOS and Android but it ends there. This phone has more problems then I can possibly list but I'm going to mention just a few. * Phone locks up on a daily basis for no reason. * Camera locks up almost every time it's used. * Locks up when switching from still camera to video. * Intermittent keyboard shows up when it feels like it. Phone must be rebooted. * Bluetooth is on but when call comes in it disconnects. * Must be rebooted when entering a new wifi area (such as between home and work). * Copy and paste only works sometimes. * Deletes contacts randomly. * Deletes apps randomly. * Randomly turns itself off. * Music app randomly deletes downloaded music. * Settings change on their own. * Rebooting takes up to five minutes. * Email system has many flaws. * No YouTube app and all aftermarket ones stink. * Low amount of apps available but not a huge issue. * Alarm is not usable unless you keep your ringer on. What company would do that? There's really too many problems to list here. This phone is running WM10 and gets all of the updates. I keep a minimum amount of apps loaded to simplify problems. Cache cleaner and performance apps are run weekly. Reloading WM10 hasn't helped. Windows has a great opportunity to be the leader in cell phone operating systems but they just can't seem to get their act together. Too bad. Skip it. NOTE: Do not buy a phone from BREED. They sold me a new phone that was clearly used. Amazon was going to make good on it and take it back but I was in the middle of moving to a different state and couldn't return it.",

I have been using it for two days and all functions appear to be working correctly. I installed my own AT&T nano sim card with no problem. I also installed a 50gb micro sd card. I like this phone because: 1-I like the Windows Phone OS. It came with Windows Phone 8.1 installed. 2-The large screen is easy to read. 3-The response is very fast. 4-Having a micro SD card slot is very useful and you do not have to take the phone apart to use it. 5-The screen display is bright and sharp. 6-I also bought the Amzer Pudding Soft Gel TPU Skin Fit Case which gives some protection to this large phone without adding additional size or weight. I recommend both this phone and the reseller.",

            "body": "It's a great device, simple to use and easy switch from iPhone. Screen is huge, easy to read and see. Little too big for a smaller hand, some times requires two hands to operate, so for work on a go while driving use voice feature to text and email. Not many apps just yet, but has everything I used on iPhone, so not a big deal. You will look goofy if you put this tablet to your ear, it's just that big and bulky. You will notice how fast this processor is, I do not wait for any app to open, almost instantaneous. If you like to take pictures, this thing has 20mgpixl cam, not as good as my wife's Lumia 1020, but much better then my iPhone. To have Office in your hand is a huge plus that Apple was not able to provide for me, I keep ton of files stored on my phone for easy access on a go. If you have small hands, this phone is not for you, go with a smaller screen like 1020.",

            "body": "I am a self admitted cell phone addict. i have various versions of iPhones up to IOS 7and Android phones up to Kit Kat. I became board with the same old stuff so I decided with some caution that I would make the switch to Windows Phone 8. I was very fearful of a lack of apps, but it turns out that the majority of the apps that I used on other platforms were available on WP8. The ones that weren't available had similar apps that were as good as or better than the original. The phone itself is a work of art. The build quality is every bit as good if not better than any model of iPhone. The screen is second to none in my opinion. Its bright, and the colors are incredible. Its very easy to read in sunlight. The button locations are very intuitive. The speaker is very loud and also clear. The battery life is amazing. I consider my self an average to slightly above average cell phone user. The phone comes off the charger at 4:15am every day. Buy the time I go to bed at 10:00pm I still have any where from 65 to 70 percent charge left. The phone is large. There is no question about that, but its also thin and feels very good in the hand. If you are looking for a large screen phone that does just about everything perfect, then look no further. The toughest choice you will have to make is which color to get.",

            "body": "I used to own a Galaxy Note I since its release, was happy with its size and the abundant apps but for the past 6 month I started to feel the pain for Android's lousy and slow software. The LTE can also suck all the power from a fresh charge in 6~8 hours, so I had to turn off ATT data network anywhere I can use WIFI. Last Friday I finally jumped to Lumia 1520. Now it has been 3 days and I can't express how happy I am! Here are few things I feel great about this phone: 1. The system is fast and smooth - hardly feel delay when switch apps. 2. Integration with Office makes open email attachment so convenient and productive 3. Photos took by the camera are crispy clear and I have not tried to adjust the settings yet. 4. Live tile, man, I love live tile. With a 6 inch screen and adjustable tile size, all my calendar appointments, the weather, the battery usage, the news app I installed, all dynamically displays like music. A quick glance and I know what is going on and what I will up to, no app launch is needed! 5. The voice enabled Nokia GPS drive is accurate, clear and LOUD, it will retire all your GPS device forever. 6. If you use Skydrive, the integration with Skydrive is really smooth and seamless. 7. Battery performance is exceeding my expectation. With LTE or WIFI (I even don't know which I am using now), after a relatively heavy 2~3 hour web usage and a full day random use, I can still have 50% power left by the end of the day. Now are few things I don't feel great about: 1. I really want to have the App/function to automatically mute my phone in working/sleeping hours but seems it is not supported on Windows phone 2. The phone is big as we know, so one hand dial is virtually impossible. If you are driving, even pick up the call will be a problem with one hand(I know, I know, don't drive and .....) 3. I still wish I can have those missed Apps I had on Android, comparing those app I installed on Galaxy Note (about 20 of them), I found all my apps in Windows Phone App store except 3 are not available. btw, anyone want to jump to windows phone, you can check here for available windows phone apps: [...] then you can decide if some critical Apps are missing when you switch the ship.",

            "body": "Lumia 1520 is one of the best phones I have ever used. Following are the few things I believe are the best in this phone compared to other phones ( I have some links towards the end to back my review ) * This phone has one of the best battery life, it has a huge 3400 mAh battery, and i generally have 50-60% left at the end of day (1) * This phone has one of the best screens. Full HD 1080p and the best outdoor visibility (2) * The second best camera in any phone right now, best being lumia 1020. 20MP camera which takes great photos in low light and OIS makes photos/videos crisp. OIS (optical Image stabilization) means the lens uses mechanical ball bearing and magnetically powered motors for stabilization during photo as well as video. Or put more simply the lens moves in the opposite direction to compensate for any small hand movements/vibrations to make the photo/video more stable. * To my knowledge, only two smartphones right now can shoot photos in RAW/DNG ( Lumia 1020 and Lumia 1520 ) (3) * One of the loudest and best speakers on any phone. No need to buy the small $100 portable bluetooth speakers, because the speakers on this phone are loud enough. * The best innovation in this phone is audio recording. Phone has 4 HAAC microphones, and allows directional audio capture for the best noise free recordings of events (4) * Nokia owns the Here Maps(Navteq) so you can download offline maps for anywhere in the world for free. Thats right, you have a worldwide GPS with the up-to-date maps. No need to use crazy amount of cellular data while using google maps or worrying about losing navigation when there is no data connection far from cities * I use my smartphone to check time, but hate clicking the power button every time. Lumia 1520 comes with Glance screen which is always on, shows time and notifications without touching the device. Uses only 4-5% extra battery a day. * Another Lumia exclusive feature is double tap to wake, comes in very handy while phone is sitting on your desk. * In cold weather ability to use your phone with any gloves, also comes in very handy versus buying special gloves for most other phones. This is a large phone, so be mindful of the size before u order. It fits comfortably in my pocket(even jeans), and my hand ( I dont have giant hands). I picked my wife's iphone 4 recently and it felt like a flip phone. Its amazing how quickly we adapt, whats normal to us changes quick. I am of the opinion a large display phone (phtablet) is better than owning two separate devices (phone and tablet). Almost everyone who sees my phone makes a comment, but i have noticed that only iphone users are generally almost hostile about the size of Lumia 1520. iphone users think owning an iphone is cool, but in reality something that 50% of the population owns cannot be cool by definition. I am not saying owning a Nokia makes you cool automatically but an iphone is def not cool anymore. Also, many of these iphone users might run to buy a bigger phone when apple makes one (5) Android is a great option too but I wouldn't buy an android phone because of the malware issue (6) and in general of google poilcies, in Eric Schmidt's own words (7) So to wrap up i think this is one of the best smartphones hardware wise and Windows Phone is a great OS, so if you are in the market for a new phone give this a try, go to your local At&T store play with it and more competition means us the consumer wins.

            "body": "I have four of these phones. The first one I bought new, but dropped the poor thing and the screen gradually went black and unusable. So I bought three used ones from different sellers. Tip: Do not upgrade to windows 10, it will totally mess it up. I upgraded two of them, I am glad I still have one left with windows 8.1. One of the used ones barely works if not plugged in, so I bought a little solar charger which can be charged with a wall outlet as well and it is happy. I use one as a phone and it works circles around any other brand of phone when it comes to conference calls. The battery on that one never quits, it is totally amazing. They take excellent printable pictures and edit pictures to look their best. Windows 10 lost all my contacts three times (!) but because I have so many of them, the app \"Transfer my Data\" restored them from one of my other phones. Windows 10 will not show thumbprints on the pinned website, which makes that feature useless to me. One of my phones I overloaded with pictures and it quit. So I let it rest in a drawer and then deleted all these (hundreds) of pictures. Now it works fine. I think I can resurrect the phone that doesn't want to work unless it is plugged in by deleting the pinned explorer pages. Might as well since it doesn't show thumb prints. I had upgraded to windows 10 with it hoping it will help the battery life, but it didn't.",

            "body": "My 5s was smashed to oblivious (in a liferpoof case too.. weird?). So I figured it was time for something new. I was very hesitant, nervous, and first question I asked ATT was (when can I return it?). It was huge, bold, loud, and shiny, and seemed cool on the surface. I went over my head, being a cloud advocate, everything I would have to do (contacts.. iCloud calendars, pictures, tasks, email accounts..) Before this, it was seamless, get a new iPhone, plug in my icloud account, and boom... done.. But sometimes seamless is boring.. Here's the things for you iPhone advocates you will have to do without.. lets get that out there now. (I have a iMac, MacBook, two ipads, wife has iPhone, AppleTV etc... all connected under one account) - iCalendar is gone on this phone. You can access a very mundane version of it through the phones IE browser, but it's impossible to read, zoom out, navigate, or add / edit events - iCloud storage is gone. There is no storage access with Apple's iCloud, completely different system - The beloved iMessage is gone. If you have friends on the iMessage system, they better get used to the old \"green\" text and using cellular to get in contact with you. No way around that unless you use apps like facebook, whatsapp etc... - Photostream is gone - And a bunch of obvious things because it's Windows, not Apple Now here is why I LIKE this phone - The screen is gorgeous. Hands down, best screen on the market, 6\" full 1080p deliciousness - 20MP Cam with 1080p. The picture quality is ridiculous. And paired with the Nokia Creative app, you can bust out some almost pro-like DSLR type photos with high quality video - The phone itself. For being such a monstrosity of a phone, it feels great to hold. Landscape view is awesome, and it actually fits my pocket just fine (I'm a dude who wears pants, no murse) - The live-tiles, OS, and navigation is top-bar quality. The phone is just fun to navigate through, and with high quality apps. (Weave, MixMusic, News etc...) The ability to rearrange to your liking from size, colors, live tyles, backgrounds etc is awesome. The updates on the tiles are a plus, one thing you don't have with iPhone (widgets for Android comes to mind). Easily spot weather updates, any news.. updates to facebook etc.. - CPU. This thing is fast.. opening apps, switching between apps, it just so responsive and barely has a hiccup - Games / Video etc... Gaming is great on this thing. If you're an XBOX ONE user, using this as a second screen is pretty sweet. The games for the phone itself are pretty quality, look great, and the extra space with the screen size is a plus. Watching videos on this thing is on par with your quality tablets out there In conclusion.... Though this is a step away from what I'm used to with Apple, it's been a welcome change. I've tried Android and could not get into, and did not like it all. This however, being windows based, has been pretty awesome. And so far I'm satisfied. If you are a iPhone user, I don't think the transition will be bad unless you were a heavy cloud user, you'll have to switch from everything Apple based, to Windows cloud based (onedrive, sky drive.. etc...). All in all superb phone, definitely will hang onto this one for a year, until the next thing lol..",

            "title_review": "This Lumia really looms...",
            "body": "... but I don't mind it. Yep, it's the biggest Windows Phone out there and a rival for the Android \"phablets\" out there, but this one has better internals than any of them, on top of a much more user-friendly user experience. That's right, WP8 has been around long enough for me to say it without fear of immediately being burnt at the stake: Windows Phone is a faster, better mobile OS than Android. Power users will sometimes complain about the lack of one or two apps upon which they rely on the other system, and while that's legitimate in some cases, I've found WP to do everything I need a phone to for years now. I am an Android user as well, and my Nexus 7 sees plenty of use, but I wouldn't want Google's OS as my go-to device for communication. WP8's core features are so bullet-proof and fast to use that I am sure I will be sticking with them for my phone for a long time, even though I'm invested in Android's ecosystem on my tablet. The best thing to happen for WP has definitely been Nokia's risky business move to exclusively focus on this OS. Their hardware is simply beautiful, as well as reliable (I've used the 900 and 920 for quite awhile) and top-notch. When you hold them and use them, their devices have every bit as much appeal as do Apple's, but they don't even come close to overlapping. Nokia's design is focused on color, freshness, sleekness and practicality. I remember talk when the first Lumia, the 800, came out of how the phone hardware mimicked the OS's bright and bold but utilitarian design, and they've kept that mentality going. Last year's flagship was the 920, then the 1020 with its beastly camera stepped in with upgraded specs, and the slimmer 925 also made an appearance, but as an overall poster child of what OS and hardware can do together, the real king is the 1520. You can read over the specs for yourself: 1080p IPS display, Snapdragon 800 quad-core 2.2GHz processor, 20MP optically-stabilized camera. Those sound great. But even great specs don't mean everything, the key thing is if they work. They work! The 1520 is a massive phone, but it is all polish, with no real faults to find. The whole phone runs at blazing speed with the top-end processor. Size is the major factor in whether this phone appeals to you. Photos don't really do it justice - you have to see it in the polycarbonate to grasp how large it really is. That said, it uses its size in the best way possible: the beautiful screen. I love IPS technology; its color reproduction is excellent, not only saturated and vivid but accurate, and such things matter on a 6\" screen. The back of the phone is Nokia-standard toughpolycarbonate, either matte or glossy (in the case of the colorful versions - I've only seen the red, so I can't be totally sure on the others). I prefer the higher-quality feel of the matte on any Nokia device, but with this one it's especially important, because you need grip to hang onto such a large device. To be sure, its weight is quite reasonable, just heavy enough to feel solid and reliable, but there are lots of times I don't have my fingers locked around its edges, but am letting it lie in my palm while I use it. The matte finish of the black phone sticks just enough to the surface of my palm to be comfortable doing so. The 1520 is also nicely thin. In fact, I think its dimensions and weight are close to perfect. They scream good design. The OS update that allows three rows of live tiles comes in especially handy, since you can get almost everything you need onto the screen without scrolling, and even with large tiles, which report a lot of information on what is going on with the app, making this an even better glance-worthy device than the other WP models. Lastly, the camera is on par with other Nokia models (not including the 1020, which is a class unto itself) in performance, with a couple of caveats. One, the maximum aperture is somewhat smaller (f/2.4 instead of f/2.2 on the 920), meaning that this camera has to bump ISO sooner than the 920 in low light. You can still set ISO manually, which I recommend. ISO 100 shots look buttery-smooth. This is also the first camera on a Nokia device to support RAW (DNG) files, which I have yet to test in Lightroom but am looking forward to getting my hands on. All in all, this phone is impressive enough to warm a person who thinks \"phablets\" are dumb, which incidentally was me. I'm more than willing to make the size trade-off for the many excellent features the 1520 boasts, and am looking forward to what Nokia and Microsoft have in store for their new flagship device!",

            "body": "This morning I dropped my phone without realizing it while walking through the lawn in the rain. It sat out in the rain for about ten minutes before I realized what happened and went looking for it. It still works, which prompted me to write this review. This is the third Windows Phone that I have owned and, without question, the best phone I have ever owned. My wife has a Galaxy Note 3, which I liked so much that I nearly got one for myself, but, after seeing her experience with it after owning it for nearly a year, I'm glad I didn't. My battery lasts triple the time of most phones that I see and I can easily get through 24 hours with only about 30 minutes to an hour on the charger. It's such a pleasure to use on a daily basis; the newest features (Cortana, voice text, swipe keyboard, etc) are incredible and I use them daily. Everything tends to \"just work\", which is a great thing for a phone. I need functionality from my computer, but I need speed and ease-of-use from my phone and that's one are in which the Windows Phone platform beats out most Android phones. It's built like a tank; I have dropped it multiple times and there is barely a scratch. I will admit, there are times when it's size can be awkward, but I feel that all the times when it's so nice to have a big screen (watching movies, reading, playing games, showing pictures) outweigh any inconvenience. Some recommendations:don't buy the 32GB model. You can buy a 64GB microSD card (under 40 on Amazon) for less than the difference in cost and end up with more space than you will ever use. I'm also on the developer's preview build of the Windows Phone OS; I wouldn't recommend that to most people as the current release has all of the features you want with less bugs. It's nice to get a lot of features ahead of release but they tend to be buggy.",

            "body": "Let me start by saying this phone is amazing.This is my 6th windows phone in a span of 1 year. I keep phone maximum for 3 months and sell it with good value. Earlier i had Lumia 1020 which is amazing phone too. I was in market for a mini ipad.Then i came across this phone . So i thought why not buy Lumia 1520 which can be used as a mini tablet and phone.I have no regrets in buying this phone. Below is my experience with this phone. Form Factor: Yes phone is little big. As this is a phablet category, the size is expected.We cant have a SUV's room in a compact car. So the benefits of large screen is obvious. Also at the same time there will be some inconvinience. Both Hands: Yes most times you need to use both hands. For instance, you cant use back button without using 2nd hand. But i got used to it.After couple weeks ownership , i dont feel this as a inconvinience any more. It matters most in a CAR where you need to handle the phone single handed. So all the time i mount my phone and i can use single hand. Screen: Screen is great and retina. But if you use phone screen without any protector then the screen is very slippery. Camera: Didnt test much but looks as good as lumia 1020 with less zoom. Slim. This phone is very slim when compared to lumia 1020. there is no bulge on the back so it sits flat.I se phone for movies at gym. Lumia 1020's camera bulge was always a chalange at gym. As 1520 sits flat, it is more secure. Speed: I dont think i see much speed improvement over 1020. Though it is quad core ,system still takes time to repsond on certain apps.I believe the speed has to do with particular apps then the phones hardware.When i switched to 1520 ,i thought some lagging in 1020 will be gone in 1520/. but certains apps still lagg. Lanyard: I miss Lanyard of lumia 1020 in this phablet. As this is a big phone, Nokia must have Lanyard option. To remedy this, i added my own . I used incipio air case and added Lanyard to the speaker grill. It works great as the case is strong. Speakers:It is almost same as lumia 1020 speaker with 10-15% improvement in volume. The clarity is same. Both speakers are great. Ear piece could be louder. I dont know but Nokia Lumia series suffers with low ear piece volume. Red Lumia. Red is slippery as every one suggested. Incipio case took care of it. Tiles: Extra column for tiles is a plus. Now one can see more information without moving the screen. Side Keys: Side keys are too flat. It is quite difficult to find volume keys and lock keys .It could be better like lumia 1020. Phone in public: Yes it is eye catching. It doesnt look good if you talk on this phablet in public. But who cares.when Iphone first came, it looked too BIG. but it has become new NORM now. So people will get used to it as phablets become more popular.Also it keep you out of crowd. Pocket: It easily slides into pocket. In my formals and jeans i have no issue in sliding the phone. It fits and doesnt pop out of pocket. As it is slim, the extra length doesnt bother me. Wireless charging. I am really mad on ATT on removing wireless charging from this phone. Hell with the technology and standards. IF they care too much then why did they sell qi wireless chargers. Now that every one got one qi wireless chargers they removed this from phone.ATT ------ in this regard. battery: Awesome. It has very good battery life.It is almost twice that of lumia 1020. I tested battery by turning on everything.Even though the location was turned on, the battery drain was not significant. I believe if location is not used by any app then system turns it off.",

            "title_review": "Behold: the Slablet!",
            "body": "The short summary: I've been a long-time user of Android phones but a few months ago I decided to try the move to a Windows Phone. I thought I'd miss some of the goodies, but the truth is, Windows Phone has been great. I bought this through AT&T Next--I don't want to bore you with AT&T details, but I'll put some of that info at the end for anybody who wants to know. The Lumia 1520 is great hardware, but will take some getting used to because of its size. Being bigger than a Phablet but only slightly more portable than a tablet, this slab-like body I have dubbed \"The Slablet\". The full review: About the phone The Nokia Lumia 1520 is very thin for its width and height. It barely fits in a pocket, but it doesn't take up much space once it's there. The screen is huge, nearly filling the front, and the slight raised bump on the back for the camera lens isn't very noticeable. The black body feels tactile and not slick, with a matte finish, but I went one extra step and skinned it with the Skinomi TechSkin that makes it look like woodgrain. It takes big hands to be able to wrangle this phone: it's skinny, but it's a big slab just the same. If you can get used to this, then the size pays off in the quality of the screen. The OLED screen is very bright and it auto-dims very well in various conditions. No screen seems to do well in direct sunlight, but I have to credit Nokia because this one comes very close. The battery charges fairly quickly, but the battery usage is amazingly good: I tend to top off the charge every 2 or 3 days instead of having to worry whether I have to charge up every night. Side note: while we're on the subject, the Lumia charging pad does NOT work. The manual says it is supported, but as you will see in reviews of the charging pad, it doesn't work on the 1520: the power induction technology was changed and isn't compatible. The phone powers up and down very quickly, apps respond fast on launch, and the sound quality is very good in standard phone calls, so-so in speakerphone, and excellent in Bluetooth. There aren't anywhere near as many apps in the Windows Phone Store as there are in Google's Play Store or Apple's store, but I've found plenty to do whatever I wanted (including ports of popular games like Angry Birds). There is a KitKat Launcher app that will run the Droid OS on Windows, and it runs pretty well...but I haven't found that to be a \"port my old apps\" solution because it doesn't have the ability to run the Play Store and pull down my apps--some side-loading required. Eventually I realized I just didn't need some of the things I used before because Windows Phone has an equivalent. The camera takes wonderful high-resolution 20MP images. Using it is easy: even with the phone locked, you can turn it sideways in your hands, hold it like a traditional point-and-shoot camera, and use the button on the 'top' right to snap pictures, adjusting your shooting (or video) settings with the touchscreen. The flash works very well, and it's rare that I move around enough to cause motion blur. Pinch-to-zoom works, but more importantly the Nokia Camera app (recently rebranded \"Lumia Camera\") will let you adjust the most minute \"manual mode\" settings that any camera pro would love to play with, such as ISO, flash settings, etc. There's also a built-in image editor that I've used to tweak color balances, crop, and otherwise adjust images to save me the trouble of loading them into an image editing program on a computer. About the Windows Phone OS If you've used Windows 8 or an Xbox One or a Surface tablet, you've already been exposed to how the OS behaves. Every app has a square tile that represents it, and the tiles are large and easy to tap on. The main screen lets you put whatever tiles on it you like, and they scroll from top to bottom--but if you need one that's not on the main screen, a quick swipe to the right will pull up the list of everything on the phone. The Phone OS runs very smooth, launching apps quickly and multi-tasking well: I can run music via Bluetooth while navigating on the maps and when a phone call comes in, it all gets handled easily--and most importantly, consistently. The interface will pretty much look and feel the same for most of the apps that you use: you have some buttons for interaction, you have an ellipsis button \"[...]\" that brings up options, and the menus are large, bright text on a black background. Swiping and flipping around in the settings is fast and easy. I like the fact that the dialing menu makes it easy to flip through call history, contacts, speed dial, and voicemail, and that voicemail messages are pulled down to the phone and can be played like any media player app, with play/pause buttons. The only app that misbehaves is Facebook, and that seems to be the rule these days on more than one device I used it on. Facebook's interface is inconsistent and its behavior sometimes gets weird. I haven't had a single app crash on the phone, but Facebook comes close. So let's talk a moment about the details: Cortana. This voice-driven virtual assistant was a brilliant idea. After interviewing personal assistants for executives, celebrities, and more, the product team came up with a personality that is intended to handle your every need through voice interaction. This is a great app, but unfortunately only when it works. For example, I said, \"Cortana, set up an recurring appointment on my calendar, for every Monday and Wednesday, starting on January first. Name the appointment \"Yoga\".\" Believe it or not, this worked. But then I try something I read on a website about Cortana, and instead of it providing me an interactive response, Cortana brings up a Bing search on my screen and leaves me to figure it out. And yet...I was running the other day and she popped into my Bluetooth to tell me I just got a text message. We talked our way through playing it back to me, repeating it, and then calling the person back, all without touching a button. So when it works, it works well...and when it doesn't, you just wish it were consistent. OneDrive: this used to be called SkyDrive, and it's Microsoft's built-in online storage. I use OneDrive all the time with no real fuss. I can count on it to automatically upload my photos and videos, I can open documents I have stored out there, and it's actually more hassle-free on the phone than it can be on a PC. I don't currently run Office on my phone because I have a Surface Pro, but it does appear that the integration with Windows Phone for Office is probably better than the weird and limited versions of such apps on Android. Mail: Outlook looks and feels like the browser-based version, but seems to behave a little better. I've also added my Gmail accounts and the UI looks and behaves the same, but they appear as separate icons on the main screen. Maps and Driving: this is probably the only sticking point with a Windows Phone: Microsoft's identity crisis with Nokia. The Maps app works very well and is easy to work with. It gives driving directions by voice or lets you just view step-by step text instructions. There are two Nokia apps on the phone (Here Drive+ and My Commute) that are fantastic...but limited. So for example, the tile for My Commute regularly shows me how long it's going to take me to drive home, and gives a red exclamation point if there are any reported accidents along the way. Microsoft's Bing Maps updates traffic about every 2 minutes. When I'm driving, if I go a different route, both apps make a note of it, and amazingly enough, I get tiles at the top of the screen showing me the approximate times for each route, so I can know which one has the worst traffic. All of this works because there's a handoff under the covers between My Commute, Here Drive+ and Bing Maps. But sometimes when I launch My Commute, it doesn't make the handoff and it never gets started tracking the commute. Other times, it's supposed to present me with the Start button and it doesn't come up--the main screen just gives me options to add more commutes or delete one. The same happens with Here Drive+, sometimes I ask it to give me directions and it doesn't launch Bing Maps. Or it doesn't give me voice. Another app that when it works, is amazing, and when it doesn't, you just wish it were consistent. In the end, the Nokia Lumia 1520 is a really good overall data device: it is almost as capable as a full-blown tablet and it's also a great piece of hardware for a phone. The features of the Windows Phone OS range from amazing to mediocre, but overall it can do just about any basic day-to-day task that you might expect a smartphone to do. Microsoft have done a good job of marrying the OS to the device, with a few awkward Nokia-app fumbles here and there. Overall if you're looking for a Windows Phone, this is the best model that has the ability to add storage. You should probably try to get your hands on one first though to see if this is really something for your hands that you will be willing to haul around. AT&T Next info: to be honest, I spent more time agonizing over whether to take the plunge with their plan than I did over whether to switch to Windows Phone. After research, phone calls to AT&T Customer Service, and some support Chat sessions, I finally figured it out. The newest smartphones always cost hundreds of dollars, and the days where a phone company was willing to eat those costs to get your business are coming to an end. AT&T gives you a bit of upgrade leeway with Next because even though you're effectively agreeing to buy the phone at full price and stretch out the payments, there's also a certain window towards the end of that time where you can walk away from the payments and trade up...so long as, like in the past, you're entering into a new agreement. The \"incentive\" they give you is that Next users have access to cheaper monthly plans (and this can get really complicated if you dig into it)...for us, it didn't lower our already-good family plan, but it did mean we could keep said plan, where other AT&T upgrade offers would take features away or add costs. Not a pleasant situation, but also not much of an option given that where I live, AT&T dominates the airwaves.",

            "body": "I was a little skeptical about the size, however after owning this for about a month, I wouldn't go any smaller. Here's what I do to make it work. My frequently used icons/tiles are on the third column on the right. (Phone, messages, email etc.) Other tiles, I have on the left. This allows for any easy reach with my right thumb. It is difficult to reach the middle/top left tiles with one hand. I have placed tiles that typically require two handed use there. Battery life is unbelievable. I can go almost a day and a half with moderate-heavy usage. I have installed the 8.1 preview and although there may be a few bugs, this phone is rock solid smooth and fast. The display is awesome!! Cortana, although in beta has been very good. The voice recognition is fantastic!! The camera takes some incredible photos. I was a little skeptical about getting 16gb only. Knowing the device had a micro SD slot, and the software upgrade would support a memory card for app installation, I decided to go with it. I added a transcend 64gb SDXC Card type 10 and it works great. 80gb total!! OneDrive, Office, Nokia Drive - built in navigation with downloadable maps make this a complete package. Nokia Beamer is pretty cool too. The only thing I miss is the wireless built in charging (QI).",

            "body": "I have the ATT version of this phone which is missing the Qi Wireless Charging and only has 16GB of onboard storage. I 100% blame ATT for this not Nokia. As far as I'm concerned ATT is garbage. Pros Screen - Great colors, reading angles, and clarity. The screen has deep blacks and is very visable in direct sunlight due to the clearblack technology. The 3rd row of tiles on the hoimescreen is great. OS apps do take advantage of the larger screen size and show more text like in email, etc. Weight - The phone is not as heavy as I thought it would be. I previsouly had a L920 which has a lead weight. Camera - The 20MP camera is very good and fixes all of the issues that the L920 had. Polycarbonate Body - The L1520 is matte in white, which is what I have and it has a really great feeling. MicroSD - Many WP do not have MicrosSD, especially Nokias. This phone supports up to 64GB. You can only move media files to the storage right now (music, pictures, videos) not apps, but that is coming in WP8.1 I do not install tons of apps so this does not affect me. Cons Touch Input - The phone exhibits strange touch behaviour where scrolls are occassionally seen as touches. This is software and I'm sure Nokia will fix it, as they are very on top of issues. Size - At first the phone was a little bit to large, but after about 2 weeks it has been nothing but great. I will never get a smaller than 5\" - 5.5\" device again.",

            "body": "I can say honestly, this is the best phone I have ever owned by a wide margin. I now cannot imagine going \"back\" to anything different. I have a desk at home in my bedroom that holds some of my \"outdated\" backup phones. This currently includes a Nexus 4 and a Lumia 620. Every time I go to bed now, I look at my current phone, glance at my two \"old\" phones, and think to myself, \"how did I ever use those things??\" The Lumia 1520 really is that good. Now let me be clear, it is still a phone. It's not a life-changing event, it won't make you infinitely happy, but what it will do is just be one of the best companion devices you will ever own. The camera is phenomenal. The speed is just amazing. The Bing suite of apps and live tiles are just marvelous. The screen is gorgeous. As a user, I have no complaints. However, let me highlight a few complaints that others might have. They are valid, and if you fit into this category, the phone may not be the right one for you. I am merely saying that they don't bother me, not that they aren't valid complaints. 1) The Windows App Store selection is still limited. 2) The screen is large. 3) The camera is slightly slower to launch than the iPhone's. That's it. Really. I am not a fanboy per se, I've used all \"3\" of the big phones (Android, iPhone, Windows Phone) and sincerely think they are all awesome. However, for me, this device itself is what set it apart. I looked at the Note, I looked at the iPhone 5s, but I just could not stop playing with the 1520. That's my experience, and you might have a similar one.",

            "body": "First off, I'm not here to review the operating system. You can look elsewhere for that. Overall, I was presently surprised by this phone. The 1080p screen looks great and the color reproduction is a little saturated, which I prefer. The back housing looks good, but is a little slippery to hold making it a little prone to being dropped. Camera: Fantastic, the imaging software and camera itself is a perfect combination and I have yet to see a bad picture on auto function. The led flash is really bright(which also serves as a great flashlight). From my experience, the colors are not too unnaturally vibrant. Battery: I figured that a 3500mah battery would be to compensate for the enormous screen, but it turns out it goes even beyond that. I consider myself a pretty heavy user and this battery will only be at 40% by the end of the day. If you don't use it heavily, you can easily get two days out of this. Hardware: Windows phone 8.1 isn't a very can intensive os so with a snapdragon 800 this runs extremely fast. It does get a bit hot at times when playing games but it's never really been an issue. Wife connectivity seems about average and the vibration motor is much less obnoxious than other Nokia's. The speaker is nothing special, but does that really matter? Durability: I've dropped it face down on concrete a few times and have yet to see a scratch. It's built tough. I'm a Windows phone fan and this is perfect for anyone looking to get a packet because of how well it runs, and the durability of it as well as the camera. Update 9/8/14: Phone is still great, but just as a tip for users. If you plan on getting a screen protector for this don't buy a really cheap one. The phone has slightly curved glass so cheap protectors won't adhere to it very well. Also this phone looks to be one of the best WP devices for a long time to come still. Looks to be very time resistant.",

            "body": "I've had this phone for six months now. It's a great phone! The only issue I had thus far was an over heating issue. That was due to an after market case I put on it. I've read reviews about how easily it breaks and that has not been my experience. It slid out of my pocket and hit the running board of my truck. It didn't break. It slipped out of my hand and hit the hardwood floor and didn't break. I generally find that most broken phones are the users fault. They treat a $300-500 phone like crap and then get pissy when it breaks. Learn how to take care of your stuff. Treat it well and it lasts. The camera takes pretty good pictures, front and rear. The speaker is quality. The screen resolution is excellent. A lot of people complain there is a lack of apps. If you're looking for the latest and greatest time wasters then you will be disappointed. I buy a phone to have it work for me not waste my time. The os is intuitive and easy to use. Don't like the tiles then download the app that makes it look more like android or iphone. Bottom line is this phone is great and the windows os is underrated because most people won't try it because they are locked in to their iPhone or android. I've used all the systems and this one is the best.",

Nokia of course makes solid hardware, fast processor plenty of storage (plus card if need more!). I don't know why Microsoft/Nokia aren't promoting the phone and OS more. It is a viable option, it could replace blackberry in the business space. It's not for everybody, but my wife uses the 1520 for work. Her Samsung could never reliably connect to the corporate email and vpn, no matter how much IT tried. Bought apps, still buggy. She travels worldwide and needed it to work, it didn't. With the Nokia she has had no problems at all. Some people just want to use the phone to actually get business done, not play games. Windows Phone and Nokia has been a very smooth transition, with no headaches and having to find some abstract setting to configure something that should work!!!",

            "body": "I decided to try out this Nokia with Win8 after owning an Android for the past 1.5 years (Galaxy 2 skyrocket - got it before the S3 came out). I also have an iphone 5 from my employer (replaced my old Blackberry). So one could say that I have experienced all 4 smart phone ecosystems. Before my Galaxy I owned the iPhone 3, 3GS and 4. Pros: Gorgeous screen - at 6 inches everything comes to life, and I can read the bloody thing. No longer do I have that claustrophobic feeling that I got from my other phone. The live tile metaphor on Win8 mobile works great - the tiles update so all you have to do is look at the screen. Great customization. Wonderful camera. Good battery life. Oh, and the interface is simple, does what you want without that 3rd party funkiness on Android. I actually enjoy using the apps to get the information I need. Syncing up to my PC is painless and fast, and transferring my itunes music and videos was ridiculously easy - versus the funkiness and slowness of the the Samsung Kies app on Android. App selection is decent - can't find WSJ online mobile, but at 6inches I can cruise the website! Other apps that I need are there including etrade mobile. Other thoughts on my other phones: Apple: Great OS, but you are locked into one way of doing things. And the bloody screen is small. Tim Cook needs to get a frackin' clue - I'm not 25 anymore, and I am tired of using my reading glasses to use the phone. And for the past two years I keep on hearing rumors that Apple is going to build a bigger phone, but they never do - I am tired of waiting. This is the biggest bust with the iPhone, and for me it is a serious one. I am not alone on this one, a couple of months back CNET blasted Apple on their screen size. Android: Cheap and ubiquitous. Samsung and Google are about to conquer the world with their duopoly, and that is not necessarily a good thing (privacy anyone?). At first glance the interface looks great, but has an inconsistency that is frustrating, especially between apps. If you like playing with the phone settings all the time versus using the phone for information and work, Android is the way to go. Syncing to the PC is a pain, and the transfer process is anything but straightforward. Android is the way to go if you want a cheap phone and you don't care about media.

            "body": "I already had a phone but needed greater productivity. I got a tablet but there were times it was a bit of a hassle to carry around. Solution: phablet, productive yet pocketable. As usual I did tons of research which drew me to the Lumia 1520. Interestingly one of the reasons I was drawn to it (its size) was the very reason I was apprehensive about getting it. But after some rationalizing I took the plunge. I have to say that this is one of the best purchase decisions I have ever made. At first its strikes you are being big but after a week it just feels normal and regular phones suddenly start looking too tiny to bother with. Plus I dont wear tight pants so it fits quite well in my pockets. The performance is top notch. No hitches or lags. I am quite impressed with the operating system. WP 8.1 is swift and smooth. There are more than enough apps for me to choose from to keep me productive and entertained. The browser is surprisingly good. And the battery life is awesome. You have no idea how much of a relief it is to be out whole day and into the night without worrying about battery life. As an avid photographer I love the camera on this thing. The first shot I took I was pleasantly surprised. The low light performance is great. This phone has controls you'll find on a DSLR camera. Being able to control shutter speed and focus manually opens a world of photographic possibilities. Lens apps are amazing. Reading this review suggest that you are considering getting this phablet. I have no reservations in recommending it. Its not perfect. But which device is? Prepare to get a lot of attention though when using it. It arouses a lot of curiosity and by the time I demonstrate a thing or two there are people saying they want one, except for those few who are brainwashed by Apple and Samsung marketing. One coworker did asked me to swap for his Note 3 though. All in all Im pretty happy with the 1520. And Id recommend it any day.",

            "body": "I sold my Lumia 1020, my fifth Windows Phone, to get a Galaxy Note 3, my first Android. After two months, I have sold my Note 3 and canceled my Tmobile plan and back on ATT. I sold my 1020 because I was \"tired\" of being out of the loop when it came to apps, compatibility, power user options, etc. I thought I liked having all that in Android the 2 months I tried it, but I ended up missing Windows Phone hardcore. So I decided to grab the 1520 because it was ridiculously big, and it has my favorite OS on it, Windows Phone 8. With Windows Phone 8.1 only a few months away, I got more and more excited to be back on it. I also grabbed the Lumia 2520 tablet for $99, so at ATT I got the 1520 and 2520 for the same price of a Note 3, now that's a deal! The phone is....AWESOME. The screen is massive with great viewing angles, speakers loud, best build quality out there, and MASSIVE. Everyone always laughs when they see it because it's so giant, but I happen to love the size. Having the extra column for live tiles makes the start screen way more fun to use. The camera isn't as impressive as the 1020 was, but it's close. I've managed to get some great shots. I gave it 4 stars for Windows Phone and it's crawl to catch up. I've given up chromecast for xbox in an attempt to keep myself within the Microsoft sandbox. I'm a Windows 8.1 user, so it's not THAT hard, but it was nice that Android was pretty much compatible with anything, had ALL the apps, etc... I don't know what WP can do to get to that level, but they need to do something. I'll never leave WP again because I'm just used to it and love it. I love how fast it is to get the stuff you want, the search button rules, and the OS looks awesome, but I hope 8.1 is a big update with features we are missing the most. For the love of god, Google and MS need to kiss and make up so WP users can use google stuff without it sucking terribly.",

            "body": "Simply put, the lumia 1520 looks and performs amazingly. The phone is super fast. You can have 5 different apps open and all of them will load very quickly with almost no lag in performance. I assume this is the quad core snapdragon processor in action. The camera is pretty advanced, with many configurable settings which I don't even begin to understand, but it takes great pictures on the default setting, and being able to view and edit them on the full HD 6\" screen is a pleasure. The live tiles make a lot more sense with all the available screen real estate on this phone. I have about 30 tiles on the main page which I scroll through to get quick updates from every app. The best part about this phone is the battery. I used this phone all night, went to sleep without plugging it in, and when I woke up in the morning, it still had 50% charge left! Since the phone is microsoft, integration with Office and Xbox live is seamless. Setting up your outlook email will be a snap. Gone are the old days of no having any support from the major apps. The new windows phone has instagram, vine, waze, snapchat, google maps and most of the other secondary apps people love. You still may miss out on random third party apps and games, but you won't miss those much given all the apps available and how great they run. You can stream movies and videos in full HD anywhere you go with this phone. Unlike most phones, you can also insert a micro-sd card for additional storage. Cons: You will definitely get the stares and jeers from friends making the exact same joke \"HOW BIG IS THAT THING?\" but with the huge screen and amazing performance, you will care less. The phone fits fine in my jeans or pants pockets, although women or skinny-jean wearers probably won't agree. It takes forever to charge this thing, but the battery lasts so long that this isn't an issue. Making phone calls while holding this thing up to your ear is a little awkward, but I don't make too many phone calls and I use bluetooth in my car and office anyway. I've only had the phone for 3 days so I haven't discovered all of its features and pitfalls yet, but it's off to a superb start!",

            "body": "This is not a review for the Windows Phone operating system. Just for the Lumia 1520 phone and to a lesser extent AT&T service. I'm not going to talk about the WP OS because I am pretty biased. WP OS is leaps and bounds better than its competition. The only real negative is the lack of available apps when compared to Android or iOS. Which isn't the operating systems fault. So if you are looking at this phone wondering if the windows phone OS is good... it is. But, make sure the apps you want are available before choosing. Now for the review. Going to knock out the AT&T part first. I left AT&T a year or so ago because it was way too expensive. Even with a contract I was paying close to $100 a month for lowest possible talk and unlimited texting with 2 gb of data, on a solo contract. I came back when I bought this phone because they have done a great job revising their available plans. For instance, instead of having to add $20 for the texting, it is just there. I am currently on month to month no-contract with 1 gb of data and unlimited talk/text. I did have to buy my own phone but that doesn't bother me. I only pay around $50 a month now and it is great to not be subjected to a long contract. Throughout all my time with AT&T the service has been absolutely great as well. Which is important to me since I live a very remote area and other carrier service is just non-existent out here. I have had a few smaller ones and Verizon and AT&T by far has the best service for me. I highly recommend AT&T in its current form to anyone looking for a carrier. As for the 1520... my first impression was... wow... this thing is huge! My previous phone was an HTC 8X, which is also nice, but the 1520 absolutely dwarfs the 8X. The HD 6 inch screen is totally amazing to look at. I have always had pretty top of the line phones so am used to a good looking screen, but this one blows me away. The size and view alone is enough for me to give this 5 stars. When I see other phones now, I wonder how people use such small devices! The sound is also great, even at half volume or less it is crystal clear and easy to listen to. It gets really loud too, sometimes at work I forget I had my ringer at max and it goes off... startles the entire office, which is not a quiet office... I do have one problem with the call sound, which I'll get to later. The camera is also great. Short of getting the Lumia 1020(Or maybe the Icon, haven't looked at it much), you will not find a better camera. Nokia camera technology in phones is just unbeatable at the moment as it is and this is the second best packed into a beast of a phone. In addition to the video/picture quality, if you record a lot of video with sound, you'll be amazed how clear and clean it records. Even in loud concerts and such it will sound pretty good, instant youtube upload quality even. With all that said, this is an amazing phone, but I do have a few qualms with it that you should know about when purchasing. First and worst. There is a common problem where if you plug headphones in it will make regular phone calls sound not work. It happened to me. I have to either have headphones plugged in or speaker turned on to hear on phone calls. This would be huge to some, but doesn't matter to me since I hardly ever talk on the phone. I would also imagine this is covered under the manufacturer's warranty so if it happens to you, you'd probably easily get it replaced. Second problem I had is with the touch sensitivity. There are different settings so I have managed to change some stuff and make it feel better, but I still have problems sometimes when I go to scroll or something, instead it registers a tap. This could just be me though... and still is easy to get used to and forget about. And third... this is all me probably, the screen is supposedly gorilla glass and practically un scratchable... yet I somehow managed to get a scratch on it! You probably don't need to worry about that though... I just have that kind of luck! So in summary, even with the few little problems that MIGHT occur, this is an absolutely stunning phone and still deserves 5 stars. I honestly don't think I could even return to a smaller phone at this point if I wanted to get something else... and since I am a WP fan and do not plan to get an Android anytime soon, this is THE phone for me. Hope this review helps you decide if it is also the phone for you!",

            "body": "I switched from an iPhone to a lumia 920 a few months ago because it was too soon for an upgrade but my iPhone broke. I quickly came to like the Windows format, although most of my features were several years outdated because I couldn't get the updates to work properly. About a week ago my upgrade was finally ready and I switched up to the 1520. There are probably a lot of apps that heavy app users like that aren't available, but I haven't found a single one that I wanted that I wasn't able to find. Myfitnesspal, hulu, netflix, amazon, Pandora, iheartradio, all of my favorites are there! The system is lightening fast, I haven't had it freeze up on me a single time and everything responds as soon as you touch it. The screen clarity and quality are phenomenal for watching tv. Texting and phone calls (since it is a phone lol) have been a breeze and I really like all the little customizable options that are available. The only problem I've had at all with the phone is that this phone is definitely meant to operate and be used like a mini tablet. I'm used to being able to text with one hand and that can be difficult just because of the sheer size of this phone. I wouldn't change anything about it though so I've just gotten used to either stretching my hand out to reach the other side or using two hands to text. Not one second of regret so far, love it!",

The size is not an issue for me. The case I have for it, let's it become a self-standing reader, a video watching device, and protects it as well. The user experience is smooooooth. The OS has come a long way. App store has all the apps I need. If you use a PC, you'll love the integration and ability to do light work on office documents. XBOX integration is also nice. The HD display is mesmerizing... Oh yeah, the memory is expandable. That's a big deal for me. As long as I don't drop it out of a 3rd story window, it has the stones to be relevant for quite a while.",

            "body": "I have been an android user for personal and an Apple user for work. To me those OS systems have become very boring and just didn't seem like they were moving forward in time. They update and update but still look boring with little interaction. Very simplistic. The 1520 Lumia WP destroys those boring phones. I bought this phone because I own a XBOX One and a PC with Windows 8.1 (which I love with 3 monitors, one being a touch screen). The integration and sync is flawless and Xbox live, glass just make this phone even better. I would never go back to an Android/Google product nor would I ever consider buying a personal Apple phone. MS is ahead of their times with live tiles and I think people are starting to catch on. I even cut the cord on Google's search engine and begun suing BING just because I can!",

            "body": "I've had a Nokia 1520 for about 18 months. I loved it at first. I had used an HTC Titan prior to the Nokia and it was awful, so the Nokia was a very nice upgrade. I started noticing after a few months however that it would switch screens without my fingers anywhere near it. Then, while playing songs off my playlist, it would switch songs while still playing and then jump around my playlist erratically. Then...I dropped it. The screen cracked, absolutely my fault. Then, it started dialing phone numbers without any help from me. This phone jumps around different apps without my doing anything. Through insurance, I got another new Nokia 1520. SAME THING. My current Nokia 1520 I've had now for 6 months. I haven't dropped it, nor abused it in any way. It jumps around more than my previous one. Now, while my dialing history is up, it will just pick a number in the history and dial it. While on the main screen, it jumps to my pictures and then will pick a picture and bring it up...on it's own. I'm willing to bet I'm not the only one that has this issue with the Nokia 1520, since I've had two of them, and they both exhibit the same glitch. I'm done. Switch to the LG and switching to Android.",

            "body": "I have this phone for about half year now, and replaced the phone a month ago, still two nokia 1520 showed identical problems: 1. frequently non-responsive screen (a few times every day), more often it is in non-responsive mode. for example, someone calls me and I hit \"Answer\" button, nothing happens. 2. some times, non-stop flashing screen, texts on the screen will flash up and down, non-stop. Not sure what triggers it, it can happens even when I put down the phone on desk. 3. some programs (noticeable Cortana and Bing) automatically open without any touch event, and jump between different programs. the phone is an evidence that there is no quality from either Microsoft or Nokia. No wonder they are dying. [previous review] I upgraded this phone from Lumia 520, mainly to use it as GPS and ebook reader, instead of carrying another device for reading. It is a good ebook reader and I have no trouble reading regular PDF files (using OneReader). The build felt solid, screen is very clear. However, there are a few hassles: 1. Sometimes the screen is not responsive to touch or swipe. This happens on daily basis. I have to push power button twice, then enter PIN again; Screen flashing is another issue: texts on screen move up & down a little bit rapidly as if they could not find a stable state to display them. 2. Some programs may open itself without touch: Bing search did this a few times as well as a couple of others. originally, I thought i might accidentally touch the screen, then I found it is not the case. when I put the phone on desk, I could see app opening. I have not noticed above issues on Lumia 520. so they seem hardware related. I had a high expectation for this phone tablet. after half month of usage, it is a little bit disappointment.",

            "body": "Let me start by saying I have been an iPhone user/lover/supporter since day one, and there are definitely many positives to be said for the phone and the OS, but let's face it, it's a bit boring, mainly due to it's simplicity, which is what most people seem to love about it. This is also NOT a review of Windows Phone 8, that is something you either love or hate, and has absolutely nothing to do with this phone, since if you hate the OS, you obviously do not buy a Windows Phone. This is what bothers me about some of the negative reviews here, they are negative about customer service or because they were less than thrilled with Windows Phone OS, but that is not a review of the Lumia 1520. SO I am going to make the assumption that whoever is buying this phone has done a bit of research (I know, a rather large assumption but I'll fly with it for now), and actually wants a Windows phone. Now, why I made the switch and why I am absolutely LOVING this Lumia 1520: 1. The screen is absolutely hands down the nicest, clearest, brightest screen I have ever seen on any device, be it tablet, computer, or phone. Of course it is also 6\", which is going to be a bit large for some people, but again, just like the OS, if you wanted a small phone, order a small phone. In my case I wanted the larger screen as it definitely lessens the need to carry my tablet around in many cases, and I can do things on this device that were oure torture on a 4.5\" or similar size screen. 2. The camera, although not the 41 MP of the 1020, is quite impressive regardless at 20 MP, and the software that Nokia provides make the whole camera interface 2nd to none in my opinion. There is a bit of a learning curve if you are used to just pointing and shooting, which you can still do but not to optimal effect as you can if you take control. I look forward to taking a lot of pictures and doing a lot of experimenting. 3. Did I say the screen was unbelievable? 4. Although I stated this would not be a review of Windows Phone OS, I feel I should mention that the Amber update really adds to the OS in general, and I personally like the live tiles and the customizable nature of the whole system. So, all in all if you are looking for a large screen smartphone, and are either comfortable with or willing to try Windows Phone OS, than I can very highly recommend this phone, and as you can see by the many other positive reviews many out there would agree.",

            "body": "I'm a former iPhone (iPhone, 3g, 4) and Android user (HTC Evo, Galaxy 3). Most recently I've used the Lumia 900, and HTC 8x. This is by far the greatest phone I've owned yet. Pros: Breathtaking display If you have big hands, which I do, the phone feels great and fits perfectly. Great for intense games and apps Brilliant sound and equalizers. (Coming from having an 8x which comes with Beats Audio, this phone comes with noticeably better sound, Dolby Digital, and preset equalizers to fit your personal liking.) Fast, fluid and easy to use Amazing camera and camera app Great battery life, (over 16hrs of moderate use) Micro SD support + Xbox Music and Video Hub (Do not need my 120g Zune anymore) Windows Phone 8 is a fast and easy to use OS. The app store has all you need without a million repetitive apps. The OS just works and never stalls or freezes. I find it not too limited like the iPhone, but not as cumbersome and overwhelming as Android. If you are thinking about switching OS: All three are great and have their strengths and opportunities. I personally found WP8 to fit my lifestyle and what I need the best. I don't really see myself ever going back to iPhone or Android. This is OS is truly magnificent. Cons Definitely get a case, they phone is big and a bit slippery on the hand. Battery takes a while to fully charger. On average a good 5-6 hrs. Keyboard seems to double input some keys when I touch them. Not sure if it'll get better with more usage, but it only happens every so often. Size might be too big for some users. Even with my smaller 8X I used two hands. One to hold the phone and one to input. So it might not be an issue of you are used to using two hands.",

            "body": "This phone is fast, stable and the sreen is amazing. I had owned Iphones (up to 5s) and Android phones ( up to the samsung note 3) but this Nokia phone is better, it's simple to use, live tiles is good ,very fast and hasn't stalled yet even though I have a lot of things going on at a time not like androids phones that is fast when it's new but as you install more apps the phones slow down and crash most of the time. It is a big phone but after a while you'll get use to it and appreciate the real state but definately a 2 hand operation phone most of the time. I can never go back to smaller screen again, It's funny how Iphone said they never go bigger than 4.5\" but recently there's rumor that the next Iphone is going to be 4.7\" - 5.7\". I bought a belt holster carrier case for it and it helps rather than put it inside my jeans pocket which by the way it fits but I prefer it outside. Camera is very good beats my wifes Samsung note 3 (she's jealous :) ). Some apps is missing but there always the equivalent available and the available apps are getting more and more. Nokia included apps are great, you can download maps for offline use for gps. One of the biggest important surprise I found out was that while connected to car bluetooth stereo I can have the phone read the incoming text thru the car speaker and reply or call the person by voice command without looking at the phone or taking my hands off the steering wheel the whole time. I tried that function with Samsung Note 3 and it's not the same, while the samsung will let you answer incoming call by voice command, the voice only comes out on the phone speaker even connected thru bluetooth also for text messages it only will make a sound when a text comes in but it wont give you an option to read out the incoming text you nor reply to it by voice command so if you really have to find out out who text you and read a text you have to pick up the phone and operate it while driving which is not safe and advisable.",

            "body": "I have been using an iPhone since they were first released. I have been considering the switch to a Nokia phone for some time (camera the driver) and actually tried the Lumia 1020 for a week before returning it. I couldn't stand the odd weight and balance of the lens. I've had the 1520 for nearly a month and I am as excited about it as I was when I got my first iPhone. It's hard to describe, but the feel of this phone is just right. The weight is well balanced. It fits in my front pocket surprisingly comfortably and is just awesome in my car as I can see it so well. It is easier to find music on the phone than on my Car's navigation screen, and candidly I can see the Lumia screen better than the car's so I think it's actually safer as long as your not texting. I actually only use the Lumia's navigation now as it is way clearer and simpler than the Lexus Nav I paid $2k for in my car. The camera is great and is the primary reason why I wanted to move to Nokia. I have not been disappointed. The system is really fast, far faster than the 1020, and I love the screen. It is simply easy to see. Period. Since I use my smart phone now more for the smart part and less for the phone part I honestly rarely hold it up to my head. If there is a problem that would be it, but it's so not an issue for me as it's 5% or less of the time I use this. Candidly, after using iOS for 5 years, I really like the Windows phone. Far more than I thought I would. As for apps, it simply hasn't been an issue. I travel a ton and United just put out their app so the only one I was really missing is there. I would suggest checking the apps you use, but my guess is 90% or more of what you actually use is now on windows. In my case it was nearly 100%. In summary I'm a big fan.",

            "body": "Things I like about it: - DAT SCREEN THO! People talk and talk about how awesome it is, but you literally cannot describe it with words well enough. - Viewing angles are also unbelievable. If you turn the screen until you can barely see the glass, you can still see everything on it! It looks just like a photograph! - They clearly knew they were designing a device that is \"too big,\" and they made some compensations to help that. Buttons pop out just enough to use them and no more to keep the device sleek but fully functional. The size allows for bigger buttons, but also plenty of room between them so that you can grip the phone without hitting them. - I like the fact that they left some space to either side of the 3 bottom buttons. Perfect for holding the phone by the corner with your thumb(s) while you're reading without hitting the back or search button. - The native programs seem to have been designed with BIG in mind as well. For example, when you are in a call, all of the buttons are dropped to the bottom third of the screen so that you can reach them with your fingers. - LOVE the glance screen. I have it on all the time which is perfect for my OCD time-checking tendencies, and I haven't noticed any extra drain on the battery. - Battery life is fantastic. I've been able to get solid 2 days out of it with no problem, including a lot of txting/browsing and light gaming. - The pre-installed apps are very nice! It's nice to get a phone out of the box and it handle 75% of what I'll regularly be doing - Speakers are VERY loud and clear!! Played some punk and some techno; both came through fantastically! - On the topic of music, Mix Radio is really nice to have! I was blown away by how many selections they had for some genres. - Love the fact that I can individually access my voicemails by clicking on them instead of having to log into voicemail and wait through the digital announcer. - VERY happy to be able to access my files on this phone through a regular windows explorer window. Things that are so-so: - There seems to be a small issue w/touch sensitivity that some people are experiencing, but that may be fixable through software. - Phone calls are fine. That's about it. They are clear, but could be louder. Definitely seems to be better quality than my Titan though. Things I'm not too happy about: - Every review mentions the pointy corners; I now know why. I thought they were being nitpicky about it, but they do seem to get annoying when trying to walk around w/the device. I can definitely fit it into my pants pockets, but you have to position it a certain way while driving, else you get jabbed every time you hit the brakes. - I don't like the mini USB at the bottom, or maybe how it's cut. I realize that it's probably the best place to put it, but when I'm holding the phone, my pinky naturally lays right on the port to balance the phone, and if I'm holding the phone for any period of time, it tends to be pretty cutty/uncomfortable.",

            "title_review": "My Road to the Lumia 1520",
            "body": "[...] The Nokia Lumia 1520 AWESOME! Full disclosure: I have been using Windows based smartphones since 2006. I started with the Cingular 2125 (Windows Mobile 5.0), then the ATT Tilt(8525)(Windows Mobile 6.0), then ATT Tilt 2(8925)(Windows Mobile 6.5), then HTC Titan(Windows PHONE 7.5), then Lumia 1020(Windows Phone 8) and now Lumia 1520 ( Windows Phone 8). I\u00a1\u00afm an enthusiast! So the Titan was my first Windows PHONE device since Microsoft changed the OS. I skipped the first generation Windows Phones. Honestly the live tiles didn\u00a1\u00aft appeal to me (at first, my how things changed). I was accustomed to hacking, loading, changing (abusing :-)) my previous phones with the Windows Mobile OS since it was open, and the look and file management of a PC-like interface really appealed to me then. In 2011 I started looking for a new phone. My contract was ended, ATT was courting me with deals to renew my contract. But I needed to do my research. A smartphone is a 2 year investment. You have to like what you get. So there were some hot devices in the market and (coming to market) as I discovered through my research. Forgive me for what I\u00a1\u00afm about to say but, the Samsung\u00a1\u00afs Galaxy S2 with its bright colors, and big clear display, caught my eye. Remember I was RESEARCHING and currently using the 3.5\u00a1\u00e5 screen, slide-out keyboard equipped Tilt 2. (Note I had previously subscribed to the desire to ALWAYS have a phone with a keyboard since I used it to write.) Anyway a couple of other phones came into view, the massive 4.7\u00a1\u00e5 HTC Titan was one. Now remember, phones had not yet gone huge. So this baby was big. Go ahead. Search the web for some of the old reviews and ads. You\u00a1\u00afll see. But wait a minute. Though the S2 had drifted from view, Samsung wouldn\u00a1\u00aft leave me alone. They went and one-upped HTC and started tempting me with the 5.3\u00a1\u00e5 Galaxy Note. 5.3 INCHES. FIVE-POINT-THREE INCHES! That was HUGE. And it had a pen, and could do all this cutting and pasting and drawing stuff with that pen. Dilemma, Dilemma, Dilemma. I thought about it. Two big phones. The note was launching in the US little later. Reviewers weren\u00a1\u00aft sure who the target was. It was thought by at least one I read that it was targeted for women due to its size. Maybe it would be safely tucked into a purse when not in use. I\u00a1\u00afm not a woman. But the large screen had its appeal. But I also started reading about Windows Phone and what Microsoft was doing with the OS, the deep social network integration. Live Tiles that deliver live updates. Microsoft Office integration. Xbox Games integration. The whole glance an go philosophy. And the Me tile.(Really cool, its like a command center for your phone.) Pre -Siri Voice interaction. The Hubs. PEOPLE HUB-Contacts on steroids-nicely connected and integrated with social networks. MESSAGING HUB-One place with seamless communication via text, Messager and Facebook Chat. THE PICTURES HUB-All my photos that I\u00a1\u00afve taken nicely arranged on my device AND all my Photos seamlessly integrated from Facebook and Skydrive AND my Social Network friends photos integrated as well AND a LIVE FEED of photos from social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Awesome. The Windows Phone OS created a seamless portal to the web. Though some data was online, you could view and interact with it as if it was on the device. Awesome. GAME HUB- Xbox gaming integration, achievements, Xbox Avatar. Nuff\u00a1\u00af said. MUSIC and VIDEO Hub- All my music that I load. Plus with the Music Pass I could listen to as much streaming music as I want. Watch and listen to Podcasts, etc. OFFICE HUB-Word, Excel, PowerPoint (One Note then) all in one place. Create documents and save to the device or seamlessly to Skydrive to access from anywhere, from any device later. BING- And that awesome Bing button that gives you quick built in options for doing Shazaam Style music identification, various forms of optical scanning(barcode, book cover, language translation, etc). LOCAL SCOUT- Suggestions based upon my location for places to eat and things to do.(Note some of the finer points I discovered in use though most of this I discovered via research). So after all this I set my eyes on the HTC Titan, with its 4.7\u00a1\u00e5 display 8 megapixel csmera and shipping with Windows Phone 7.5(Mango) and its 500 modifications to the Windows Phone OS. I got it. It was BIG. I was happy. Maybe a couple of months later the Titan 2 came out with a 16 megapixel camera. Really HTC? We won\u00a1\u00aft go there. But we will go here. Windows Phone 8 was announced. \u00a1\u00b0Hope I can upgrade, hope I can upgrade, hope I can upgrade.\u00a1\u00b1 Microsoft: Windows Phone 7.5 devices won\u00a1\u00aft be able to upgrade to Windows Phone 8. \u00a1\u00b0Bummer.\u00a1\u00b1 Microsoft: But you can get Windows Phone 7.8 with the new Start Screen. \u00a1\u00b0I love the Start Screen with the resizable tiles. COOL!\u00a1\u00b1 Months pass. More months pass. Turns out HTC passed on providing the 7.8 upgrade. \u00a1\u00b0Bummer.\u00a1\u00b1 Nokia. They were doing great things. Getting great exclusive apps to the platform. Building awesome phones. Camera technology was, (excuse my slang), off the hook. I bought my wife the 920 for Christmas 2012. I wanted one. I was still in contract with my Titan. (Which I still liked by the way). Started hearing some rumors(I\u00a1\u00afm a tech head, I follow tech news). I liked my big screen and hoped Nokia would make a big screen device. Heard and read some rumors of that possibly happening. But something else happened first. They went big another way. 41 megapixels big. Early August 2013 so did I. I got the Nokia Lumia 1020. I LOVE THIS PHONE(Hold on I haven\u00a1\u00aft forgotten this is a 1520 review). Awesome photos, great Amoled clear black display. Did I mention AWESOME PHOTOS? Oh yeah, I did. Anyway I bought this device after yearning for Windows Phone 8, and liking what the reviews were showing about the camera. I fancy myself an amateur, amateur mobile photographer. The 1020 is a great tool. All that said. It had not satiated my desire for a large screen device. The 1020 at 4.5\u00a1\u00e5 was .2\u00a1\u00e5 smaller than my Titan. There were rumors if a 6\u00a1\u00e5 Lumia. I saw pictures of part of it via the rumor mill on the web. It was HUGE. I wanted it. I read about it. Followed its development. Noted its entry in the market. And then I SAW IT. I was in an ATT store. It wasn\u00a1\u00aft supposed to be available for a week or so. So when I looked over to the Windows Phone section and saw this BIG SCREEN device that towered over all of the other devices on the display I was drawn in. It was \u00a1\u00b0it\u00a1\u00b1. The Nokia Lumia 1520 in black. I picked it up. \u00a1\u00b0HOLY COW\u00a1\u00b1 this thing was light. And THIN! The matte finish was smoothe, the edges were tapered. This smoothe black slate, was SURPRISINGLY sleek. Svelte. I turned it on. The 1080p HD screen was absolutely beautiful. The additional rolls of tiles on the large display did more for the home screen than I thought it could do. Its hard to put into words. But it seems to optimize the Windows Phone experience and OS. It looks like that\u00a1\u00afs the arrangement WP was meant for. You have to see it. Then I opened Word. I Write. Word on the large display and the large keys was, beautiful. If I wasn\u00a1\u00aft sold before I was sold now. I needed(well actually I need food, clothes and shelter. And air. I need air). I wanted this phone. Microsoft\u00a1\u00afs 12 days of deals before Christmas 2013. The first 20 customers at the Microsoft store get the 1520 free on contract. I follow the tech rumor mill, I saw the leak. I had a heads up about a week or so ahead. But how did it work? Did I have to camp out? Drive all the way there then find that the first 20 in line got the deal? I wasn\u00a1\u00aft camping out. I didn\u00a1\u00aft want it THAT bad. So the day of the deal, I called the store, (paraphrased) \u00a1\u00b0Hi do you have any more 1520\u00a1\u00e4s available under the free on contract deal.\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0No\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0Bummer\u00a1\u00b1 Guess I wasn\u00a1\u00aft getting the 1520. Then I remembered. There\u00a1\u00afs another Microsoft store in my area. I called them.(paraprased) \u00a1\u00b0Hi do you have any more 1520\u00a1\u00e4s available under the free on contract deal?\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0Yes\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0My name is\u00a1\u00ad..I\u00a1\u00afll be right there.\u00a1\u00b1 I own the 16 gig version with expandable micro SD up to 64 GB and as I described above the build and display are awesome. Videos are beautiful. The photos I take with the 1020 and transfer to the 1520 look incredible on the 1520 HD display. The 1520\u00a1\u00e4s camera is great in it\u00a1\u00afs own right,and if I owned exclusively the 1520, I would likely be more or less satisfied with the camera. But the 1020 takes the cake with photography and I use both devices as tools. The 1520 is also great for surfing the web due to the large and beautiful display. The Home Screens setup which allows for more Tiles- AWESOME. I think Microsoft with the Live Tiles is ahead of its time. The live data dynamically updating on, flipping, colorful, customizable, live tiles, observable at a glance on a 6 inch \u00a1\u00b0portable computer\u00a1\u00b1 that I can stick in my pocket giving me weather, email, social network updates, messages, pictures etc. is like something out of sci-fiction. IOS and Android(even with widgets) seem dull in comparison. - You really have to see it. Play around with it in the store, arrange the tile as you would like to see them if it was your device to get a feel. Yes I think Microsoft is ahead of the time with Windows Phones 8 live tiles. And on this device they really shine. If you\u00a1\u00afve never tried it, its different than iOS and Android but when you learn the OS, which is a cinch, WOW, its AWESOME! Also you often hear Window Phone doesn\u00a1\u00aft have a notification center like iOS and Android , and though there is no comprehensive centralized notification center as found on Android and iOS, as I mentioned Live Tiles provide updated info and notifications, but also the \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 Tile which is like your command center on Windows Phone and displays your image it also brings notifications to the surface by providing alerts/notifications from the OS level integrated Social networks of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn by displaying notifications on the live \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 tile itself allowing you to see those at a glance. But the \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 tile takes things further allowing you to see your (Facebook, Twitter LinkedIn) notifications by clicking the \u00a1\u00b0Me\u00a1\u00b1 tile, and swiping left you reach the NOTIFICATIONS page and can view all of your Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn notifications(mentions, likes, comments, retweets, LinkedIn requests, etc.) located in that one centralized location/center. So Windows Phone DOES have a notification center just not as comprehensive as the one coming in the Windows Phone 8.1 update this Spring or that found on the two leading platforms. But to fail to communicate that there is a degree of centralized notification accessible on WP and leave an impression that such functionality is completely absent from the platform would not fairly communicate the scope of what one DOES get with the 1520 or any Windows Phone 8 device. \u00a8C It probably doesn\u00a1\u00aft need to be mentioned that gaming on such a great screen is simply awesome. But I\u00a1\u00afll say it. It\u00a1\u00afs simply awesome. Now the Windows Phone OS has never needed bleeding edge specs because the OS is optimized for running on low spec hardware. Windows Phone even on low end devices is smooth, fast and zippy. So adding a quad core chip with 2 gigs of RAM adds a tad more zip,and enables the device to handle more intensive programs like graphics intensive games. Mostly because the OS didn\u00a1\u00aft really NEED high specs(though again there are some noticeable improvement) it future proofs the device for requirements that may be dictated by later upgrades to the OS and it puts it on par spec for spec with many Android devices on the market (which DO need high specs to run as smooth as WP). Bragging rights. So, yeah and this thing is FAST. It has the latest cutting edge hardware. And if you didnt know Windows Phone is a \u00a1\u00b0light\u00a1\u00b1 OS and is designed to run buttery smooth on low and midrange hardware -which it does! Unlike Android, which (until Kit Kat which is on less than 5% Android devices) requires high end specs to run smoothly and still stutters and hangs, Windows Phone is swift and smooth and on the 1520 with its quad-core innards and 2gigs of RAM, an OS which ran great on less, is like a race car with nitro on the 1520. The other functions like \u00a1\u00b0ROOMs\u00a1\u00b1 which allow you to have a private chat room experience with other WP8 users, which I use with my family and wife is AWESOME. The \u00a1\u00b0SHARED NOTE\u00a1\u00b1 aspect is VERY useful when grocery shopping with my wife, we split up and using a shared shopping list which we can update and sync as we get or add items is super handy and efficient. It cuts grocery shopping time down DRAMATICALLY! The \u00a1\u00b0SHARED CALENDAR\u00a1\u00b1 helps to keep the family on top of events. I have to say this ROOM functionality, using CHAT and the SHARED NOTE and CALENDAR was an AWESOME tool for my family and I as we planned my mother in laws surprise 60th birthday party! Now I don\u00a1\u00aft have kids yet, but sis-in-laws do. Kid Zone is an understated little miracle on WP. It allows you to create a separate profile for your little one to play around with only games and apps YOU specify. Yep, all of your stuff and settings are locked away safely behind your profile. The only cons I have is that as a phablet(I don\u00a1\u00aft like this word) the OS should have a couple of tweaks to utilize the extra screen real estate. Multiple apps simultaneously on screen. It is a \u00a1\u00b0Windows\u00a1\u00b1 Phone. A pen would be cool too. Even my Windows Mobile devices of old had handwriting recognition. Some modernizing of that application(digitizer) would be nice. Come on don\u00a1\u00aft get mad, everything can get better. :-) The phone is a delight. Its fun. Its useful. Its Awesome. All said I love the 1520 and I highly recommend it. Go get one now",

I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a phablet that can take great pictures and help you get things done. The issue here is that AT&T cannibalized this phone. If you planned to take advantage of the built in wireless charging that Nokia built into the 1520 you will be disappointed as that feature has been completely stripped at AT&T's request. Instead of Qi charging which is what all other Nokia phones and accessories use this phone uses duracells powermat charging. The technologies are separate and not compatible with one another. If you wanted the JBL power speakers which go great with Lumia phones, this isn't your device. Instead, I recommend you purchase an unlocked version of this phone from another GSM carrier and bring it to AT&T that way.",

            "body": "All my smartphone experience has been with iphone since 3g. So about 4+ years of just using Apple. I got tired of the small screen and Apple's reluctance to really catch up to the other phones that have begun surpassing it. I knew there would be difficulties adjusting to a new style of phone, but I loved the screen and loved the idea of a high caliber phone camera (really getting into phone photography in the last few months), so I decided to go with the Lumia 1520. The screen is big and gorgeous. I feel the size of the phone is a great fit in my hand. The battery life is AMAZING. The camera is excellent BUT there are a few things that really temper my initial elation with this phone. The number one WORST thing about the phone is the freakin' touchscreen sensitivity. Even turned down from High to Normal it's TOO sensitive. I'm sure it is just a software issue that can fix it but for now it's just about a deal breaker for me and the number 1 reason I wouldn't recommend this phone to others. Multiple, multiple times during use I will accidentally launch apps or open links that I was just trying to scroll past. Sometimes just touching the screen, even without lifting your finger or doing any gestures will cause whatever you are touching to launch. So annoying! I have to leave an open space on the live tile screen so I can flick over to the app menu without launching whatever app is there. The other thing that happens frequently when scrolling thru an article is that it will highlight a whole swath of text when you try to flick up. It's instantaneous too. Not like you're holding your finger on the text and then swiping up. Using 2 fingers spaced apart to scroll seems to reduce the number of times this happens but it certainly does not eliminate it. Again, I'm sure this is a software issue that hasn't been updated from the small screen to a larger screen so touch is getting misinterpreted, but until this is remedied, I definitely would not tell any of my friends to get this phone. The other main con to this phone, and it's not the phone's fault, is the terrible apps. I don't understand why MS isn't full on supporting the app store with fantastic apps to rival anyone else. I didn't realize how big the gap was between Apple and MS as far as quality apps go. It is vast. So many apps seem unrefined, like \"it's good enough\". There have only been a few that look and feel extremely polished. Disappointing, to say the least. All that said, I will be keeping my phone since I do a lot of camera photography and video/web reading and the screen is better than anyone else for doing those things, with an incredible battery life. But until the touchscreen sensitivity issue is amended I do not recommend this phone to others.",

            "body": "I've been using iPhone for several years and have been thinking to try something new and looking for alternatives. When I saw this phone on sale, I bought it and also ordered a \"3 Packs EnGive Nokia Lumia 1520 High Definition(HD) Screen Protector Flim Ultra Clear with Cleaning Cloth\"\u00a0 B00GBTNUKQ Pros: 1. One of the top hardware spec in the market , 6 inch FHD screen, powerful 4-core chips. This phone is much more powerful than nearly all other smartphones in the market, iphone 5s, Nexus 5, S4, etc. 2. Second the best smartphone camera in the market, next to the Lumia 1020, and this phone's camera reacts much faster than 1020, and it can save RAW format photo. 3. Free Office 365. 4. It has micro-SD card slot 5. The Nokia HereMap App and HereDrive can download maps (not only US but all countries) and this phone becomes a GPS even if you don't have data or signal! 6. The Nokia MixRadio (need wifi or data) is better than Apple's iRadio. 7. It has FM Radio function, but requires a headset to work. Cons: 1. The usability is bad! The system design do not effectively utilize the amazing 6 inch screen, the keyboard always occupy about 2/3 of the screen. Win 8 system setting is not as easy and simply as IOS: in IOS you can easily scroll the menu on the left and browse and select information on the right, in Win 8 you need to click into one and another manual options then exit and select another, and there are too many options. 2. There's only AT&T version in U.S, the AT&T remove the Qi Wireless charging function. 3. US Version does not come with headset (if you want to use the FM radio function, you need use your own headset) 4. The phone I have is extremely hot, not only when I play games, but also when I take pictures. The high temperature area is the corner on the right side of the camera (when you face the camera) 5. The screen of my phone has a minor color unbalance issue, about 1/3 of the screen close to the Win key has a yellow tint issue. Overall it is a good phone, and excellent phablet. It has wonderful hardware, but still has some design issue. Whether to buy it depends on your needs. There are other cool-looking phones in the market, such as MOTO X with customized color, iPhone 5s and 5c. There are some high-value hardware phones such as Nexus 5, which is fully unlocked with awesome hardware for only $350. To be honest, this phone is neither cool-looking (imagine when you hold such a huge thing to make phone call) nor very good \"bang for the buck\", but it is no double one of the two best phone-tablet so far. The other one is Note 3, which seems to have a more mature OS and better utilization of stylus pen, but the Lumia 1520 has a better camera. Overall, 3.5 stars.",

Now I really know which phone is the \"Worst Phone Ever\" I miss my Lumia 1520 so much that I barely use My GS6.",

When she did some investigation, she discovered that this is quite a common problem. Many of these model phones are suffering from stress cracks caused by the thin case flexing and damaging the screen. So far Nokia has not stepped up to take care of their customers, so we are left in the position of paying a deductible on our damage insurance to get the phone replaced. With no guarantee the next one won't do the same thing.",

            "body": "I like it. It is big but I work outside and don't carry a phone while working so its great in the truck when I have down time. There's a couple pipe fitting apps I couldn't get on it that are available only througha apple. Its fast and the camera is awesome as is the screen. Switching from iPhone was easier than I expected. I'm no tech wizard be any means but I was able to handle the task in a few hrs. Good overal experience and the only reason for 4 stars was due to lack of apps and there's a few annoying update pop ups Update. You will not be able to access drop screen menus, very annoying. Ie. When you hover the cursor over an option and a screen comes down with other options, this does not work in wp8. I tried everything to contact a human about this issue with no luck. Tried to contact someone on line, no luck. So customer support is the exact opposite of apple where you can talk to an American in country about issues and get some sort of resolve. There is no forward button. You will not be able to use google chrome. You can set your browser to google but your internet shortcut button is defaulted to Bing rendering that button useless unless you like Bing. I do not. I cannot access my podcast that I listen to on my daily commute through network alone. Says I need wi-fi. Never had this issue with iPhone. I am keeping my iPhone to use as iPod so I can overcome this problem and still have my pipe fitting apps. I am keeping my 1520 because of the awesome screen and all and all i do like it slightly better than iPhone for my use as a tablet. Hulu is great and the streaming has been flawless with 1-2 bar 4g service. I just hope they get some updates to fix these simple issues that apple and Android have overcome years ago. My wife is not so happy with the 1020 for the reasons mentioned above. She could be going back to apple but she likes the 41mp camera over the 8mp camera on the iPhone 5. Update, if you had an iPhone the iPhone will steal all your text messages from people with iphones and you will not get them unless you sign out of apple and turn your imessage off on your old phone. I did this and it worked fine, my wife has been on the phone for two days (6hrs) and she still cannot receive messages from anyone with an iPhone. She is less than happy. YouTube is not very easy to use either, it makes you watch full length ads and you can't get to the content. Basically rendering YouTube useless for videos over a minute long. Update AT&T is an awful company to do business with. Go with Verizon and maybe have a little better luck. I'm keeping my phone because were stuck with att for two more years. We will be switching after that. You will not be able to receive iPhone text. Apple blames it on att, att blames it on apple. I got my phone on line just before they changed ios7 my wife got on a week later after changes were made and she's not able to receive iPhone text.They told her to contact all her iPhone contacts and tell them to delete then add her as a contact again, not something you want to do with your business contacts. I know hers is a 1020 but the OS is the same. Its a windowsphone vs iPhone thing and we are the ones that pay. The 1520 is a good phone but obviously there's some serious issues.",

            "body": "You can get a list of all the awesomeness that's the phone and display from other reviews. My serious gripe is the quality of applications. They're terrible! I ditched my iPhone 5 for this. The first thing I did was download the Amazon Kindle reader. This is big enough to be a good light weight reader. It's a D- grade application. The iOS version is A+, so why is it so bad for the Windows Phone? Amazon just threw out a crappy app to shut Win phone users up. No other reason. The app crashes all the time, you have to reinstall, download the books, 75% of books won't download, and only 10% of features that other quality apps have. I blame Microsoft for this. Did they think that developers would just come running to build quality apps? Do you think Apple just sat back and did nothing? No way! They went out and ensured that there would be quality apps for their products. Granted, there are some quality apps like Office, but from other developers this is an epic failure. Microsoft should have done more. All I'd like to do now it take it back.",

Microsoft sold me this phone for $200 with 450 minutes for $39.98 and 3GB of data for $20.. I receive phone activation email with contact number. when I called the number they told me they can not help me and I have to call Microsoft number so I called them and they told me they cannot activate the phone and I should call AT&T. I called AT&T they moved my number. I asked what kind of plan I got the rep told me 450 minutes and 3Gb of data. I tried to use my data after I left home but it didn't work. I called AT&T and they told me there is no data plan on my account. if I want 3GB I have to pay $30 they don't care what Microsoft sold me because only AT&T can say how much it cost. I had to cancel my service and return the phone. I don't have a cell phone service for 3 days now.",

            "title_review": "What a wonderful combo PHONE and TABLET works wonderfully as a LARGE phone and as mini tablet! A detailed review!",
            "body": "Just to let you know, I bought this tablet phone combo in White on Amazon as it was just what I was searching for as it is a tablet and an 100 percent GSM UNLOCKED phone! I have used and tested thoroughly and found that it does have so many overall advantages. So as a techie, I tested this phone/tablet out to great lengths and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this amazing device. *This is a excellent choice in an ALL IN ONE device. For me, I use it as my primary phone with no contract plan that includes minutes and a small data plan. (Most of the time, I am on WiFi for the internet but I need my minutes to make and receive phone calls etc). Also I want to state that the phone accepts a MICRO Sim card, not a regular full sized Sim. Since I had an old Samsung Tab 2 3g with a regular Sim, I just removed my old Sim Card from the older tablet phone and cut the Sim with a Micro Sim cutter, placed it into my Tab 3 phone/tablet and my data was there, my minutes were there, worked great! Also this tablet installed an update to the OS from December 2013 and this tablet phone runs so fast now! If you are looking for: a lightweight combo phone and tablet that is very easy to hold in one hand comfortably and you want a basic and easy to use tablet, then consider this tablet. While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies. And as a bonus, if you request it, I will share with you how to get Archived Flash so you can watch online videos on the tablet. And I encourage you to ask me questions in the comments (should you have a question) about this tablet and I will answer all questions. Here are the Pros and the Cons below. PROS: 1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is good in most places I tested. And I received a STRONG WiFi signal on this device. 2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB. 3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily. 4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port. 5- Screen clarity - For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages. 6- I had a Tab 3 7.0 WiFi only and sold it to a friend, bought this one and find that it is a much better tablet. CONS: - Low internal storage - this tablet comes with 8GB internal storage (advertised). Because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage. This is not good because when you install an app from the Playstore, it goes onto your internal storage not on the External SD card. (The external SD card is meant for personal files such as your music, photos, home movies,etc). **The GOOD NEWS IS: If you do not install a lot of huge games onto this tablet, you will probably do just fine with this storage. - Heat \u2013 Under normal conditions (when not running intense games or downloading files etc), this tablet runs very cool. It did get up to 102 degrees ONCE when I downloaded lots of apps from the Playstore, but then it went back to a low 80 degrees after that. This is normal though for this particular tablet, not a cause for any alarm. Bottom line and Summary: Would I buy this phone tablet all over again? Yes in a heartbeat! If you are looking to buy a LARGE PHONE that you can use as a MINI TABLET, this is the one that I recommend to you as I love mine! Since I am a techie, you can ask me any questions in the comments under this review.",

            "body": "At less than $50, this is value. It will access LTE data, get you around the web, provide Google's voice-prompted turn-by-turn navigation, YouTube, the voice-recognition capability of Google Now, and speak-to-type. Its specs aren't premium, but you're paying less than $50 and getting a reliable old Chevy truck that won't die, that will get you out of Dodge when the zombie apocalypse comes, will start when you need it, get you through a blizzard to the grocery store or hospital. No, this isn't the status symbol see-and-be-seen luxury ride. If you want that, then pay 10 to 20 times more. Yes, 10 to 20 times more. A Nexus 6 is $549. An iPhone 6S Plus 128GB is $949 before tax. So, no, it's not a badass Secret Service-looking black Suburban, a Hummer, a Range Rover, or Porsche Cayenne, but it will get you to the same places. It is an entry-level Android and a full-on smartphone without qualification quotes. By 2015 standards, Motorola has provided a solidly functional and capable device that will perform what a smartphone should be able to perform in 2015. This is a smartphone, no doubt about it. This is perfect for a backup phone if you're between premium phones - say, selling one top of the line phone while waiting for the release date of the next latest and greatest.",

            "body": "Great \"entry level\" phone. I use quotes because to be flat out honest, this is pretty much everything most people need in a phone. Yes, there are some folks out there who need to have the latest and greatest devices, but this one probably takes care of most 80% of smartphone users out there. The finish and backing on the phone are made out of great materials. The backing is a slight rubberized material and doesn't slide off tables or in your hand. My friend has a Motorola Nexus 6 phone which is several hundreds more than this one, and the phone is pretty similar in build and finish. The Verizon model of this phone, in particular, is great because there are some simple workarounds for those who are computer/tech savvy to get the GSM slot of this phone unlocked for use on ATT and T-Mobile. Do a quick google search on \"Moto E Verizon GSM unlock\" and that should get you started. I struggled with it a little bit, but after about 30 minutes I was able to get it unlocked and used it with Cricket Wireless. 4G LTE data was occasionally inconsistent, however. Overall a great device with screen size and form similar to that of an iPhone 5. One frustrating thing about later versions of Android is the inability for apps to read/write on to your SD card (since Kitkat, I believe). I frequently listen to podcasts using the BeyondPod app, which downloads MP3s directly to the phone now, instead of on my SD card, because of the limitations on the Android OS. Still a great phone at a tremendous value, if you can get these during occasional sales at around $40.",

            "body": "Two small things about this phone. Two things that drive me crazy. 1.) NFL mobile. SERIOUSLY? Not everyone wants to watch an overglorifed game of fetch. (To put it short,bloatware.) 2.) I bought this to use on wifi. Either I have the sim card in,and it trys to activate the phone EVERY time i turn on the phone. OR i take the sim card out,and have a lovely \"no sim found\" notification at ALL times. BUT. It is a beautiful phone with little to dislike about it. Good camera,good screen,nice sounding speaker (despite it only being mono) and above all,an amazing deal. Would recommend to anyone who needs a small & cheap smartphone with moderate hardware. *4 month update* This phone is still amazing. both of my complaints i had with this phone have now been fixed. 1) NFL mobile can be disabled in the app settings,which removes it entirely from the app menu. 2)If the sim is in,it will try to activate your phone. BUT. if you turn the phone off and on 3 or so times,it stops trying and goes away completely. HOWEVER...This phone is running the Android 5.1.....if you don't know why this is a bad thing,let me explain: Android 5.1 has an issue with ram leaking... (This means your ram gets eaten up quickly and can only be fixed by restarting the phone.) If you don't restart this phone every couple days,it gets very slow. this problem would be fixed if they updated the phones firmware to android 5.1.1 or android 6.0,but unfortunately there is no update as of today.

I have been having occasional issues with the WiFi randomly cutting out for seemingly no reason, but that's pretty much my only complaint.

Only a couple drawbacks. It has NO flash. Kind of a bummer cause that would improve the camera quality marginally. It has no notification LED. That was one of the biggest things I loved about the Moto G. I didn't have to turn it on to see if I had something waiting for me. I could just glance at it and be done. The signal is weaker now that I'm using this phone. I don't know whether that's due to the phone itself or my network area. I've tried resolving this issue multiple times but keep losing signal (ironic....). Overall a fantastic deal for the price. It runs wonderfully. A little bummed out I can't root it but that's kinda expected with something locked down to a prepaid plan such as this.",

UPDATE July 1st 2016: I have been happily using this phone as my daily driver for the past few months and it has been amazing for the price. Even though it is still running lollipop, most apps and software are still supported on the phone. There are also a few lag spikes every now and then on the phone but not too often.

It can crash sometimes because the system is slow, but the battery life is great and it's fairly easy on my data plan. I maintained pretty well off of 3-5 gigs a month. It's pretty cheap too.

So I inserted an inexpensive 32GB microSD card. The advantage of the Android ecosystem is that many of the phones support SD cards. So I can buy a $11 card and upgrade by 32GB. Vs Apple. The downside is many apps won't support going onto the SD card. You have to manage it that way.",

The only thing I've noticed is that every now and then it starts running very slowly, and If you try to force it, it'll freeze for a moment, and then close out of whatever you were trying to do. That can be frustrating, but it only lasts for a moment, and then it is normal again. Frankly I think that's a pretty small issue, especially for the price and user-friendliness of this phone.",

            "body": "WHY I GOT IT: I used to have a Samsung S4, but I decided to get this phone because it had the Lollipop OS, and my S4 was getting slow. I have T-Mobile and was able to easily get my SIM card working on this phone. USING T-MOBILE ON THIS PHONE: Disclaimer: I am an Android developer so perhaps, the steps were easier for me than for an average person, but it's pretty much copy and paste to get this phone working with T-Mobile. I used this link to get it working : http://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-e-2015/general/how-to-verizon-moto-e-2015-gsm-network-t3098953 PERFORMANCE I really like this phone and was surprised at its performance for such a low price point. It's actually faster than my S4. \"Ok Google\" works great and the phone quickly loads websites/images, so no complaints here. Motorola has really kept it mostly pure and there is no bloatware. There is a feature that allows you to peek at notifications from the lock screen with a long press. I find that the Moto Assistant is pretty useful and it automatically silences my phone when I'm a meeting since it knows what my Google Calendar events are. See pics for more details about Moto's additional features. CONS When I first got it, the default messaging app was tied into Verizon I think, so I downloaded Google Messenger and set that as my default SMS app. My only other gripe is the low camera quality, but that is to be expected for something that costs about $40. The pictures are more \"grainy\" compared to my S4. DURABILITY I have dropped this phone several times without a case and it is fine - no cracks or damages. OVERALL, a great,cheap phone for casual users that don't need high-quality pictures. This is a perfect phone for younger children or people who want a basic smartphone and don't care too much about the camera quality.",

            "body": "I bought this phone is September of 2015 for my dad who is just getting into smartphones and he loves it! The phone itself is not anything compared to $400+ phone, but for $50, it is a steal. The software is great and runs really fast. The construction is nice, solid-feeling and fairly grippy. The battery seems to last my dad all day with low to moderate use. The included micro SD card slot is also a nice addition. The only bad things I'd say about this phone is that the screen is less than 720p, which as a person who has used a 2k phone, is very poor to my eyes. Also, the camera is 5mp, which looks quite bad, but again, this is a $50 phone, so many corners will be cut to meet that sale price. Pros: Battery lasts all day Construction is great Included Micro SD card slot Cons: Poor screen resolution(>720p) Poor photo quality (5mp back; VGA front) Conclusion: This phone is great for any new phone user looking for a good phone for the cheapest price.",

            "body": "I just got this Moto E and set it up. I haven't updated to Lollipop 5.1 yet, but the update is downloaded and ready to go. It is convenient and responsive, decent screen quality, and fits my hand and pocket well. My biggest complaint with this phone is it has a somewhat grainy voice quality which is reminiscent of digital phones when they first came out. I am comparing to an 3-year-old Droid Razr Maxx and a new Samsung Note 4, both of which are much better. The speaker also has a tinny sound quality. It also does not have a flash for the camera. I am replacing an older Verizon phone on a post-paid plan. This is a pre-paid phone, but it is not locked to pre-paid. I turned it on for an initial test, then turned it off before it could start the setup. It wanted me to register for a new pre-paid plan. I popped the rear bezel off with a finger nail and removed the sim card that came with the phone. I inserted the post-paid sim from my old phone and turned the phone back on. It immediately recognized the sim and displayed my existing post-paid phone number. After I completed the setup I was able to make calls and send text messages. I noticed the download arrow in the notification area. It was downloading a lot of old apps from my other phone, so I had to immediately log onto Google Play and press \"Stop\" to stop the phone from downloading. I wish there was a way to delete apps from Google Play using a computer as using the phone is slow and tedious. Plus I have these apps on two other phones, and I may have to delete them from each phone before they go away and stop trying to download. Other than that, I'm good to go!!!",

            "body": "I got this phone to try android and was very impressed with the features for the price! As an employee of Apple, I've always had iPhones, but was wanting to try an android because of boredom. This was a very cheap option with lots of features. Pros: Very strong build quality. Doesn't feel cheap like the Samsungs I've tried. The rubberized curved back made it easy to hold on to without a case. The reception seemed just as good as my iPhone's I've had. LTE was quick. The processor seemed to be on par with the iPhone 5 of a few years ago according to benchmarks, and was snappy enough for every day use. The non-cluttered version of android was nice and probably helped with performance. Still was able to load clash of clans and even real racing 3 in reasonable times. Graphics of course didn't seem on par with iPhone or more expensive android devices, but I didn't expect that. I was able to load in my SIM card from my regular contracted line with an adapter since it was a nano sim, and it activated with no issues. Cons: The reason I didn't subtract any stars for these was because it was $50! Even at the normal unlocked price at $100, it's still a good deal. Most of my complaints are OS related and not because of the phone itself. Motorola has been doing quite well at making quality devices for good prices the last couple years (see the new Moto X!). If I wasn't so invested in the Apple ecosystem, I'd probably switch. The camera quality was awful, but I expected that from a 5 mp camera with no flash. So unless there's good lighting, don't expect to be the most popular person on Instagram. The screen size was good, but it wouldn't have hurt to put a 720p screen on like the previous year's Moto G. It is very low resolution, but again, it was $50. Just don't expect HD video quality. THE MAIN ISSUE I ran into was because Android Lollipop doesn't allow you to install apps straight to the SD card. So even though you spend money on a large SD card to make up for only having 4gb available because of the OS taking up half the storage, you still end up running out of space because it can't download updates anymore if you have a lot of apps. I tried everything in moving all the apps possible to the SD, but it still downloads the updates to the main drive before transferring them. I gave up trying to have any large games on it more than 1 gb. Overall, it was a good temporary device, but I didn't keep it since it wasn't functional enough to take complete advantage of the extra storage you add.",

            "body": "While this phone can leave some to be desired if approached with the wrong attitude, it not only gets the job done but has impressed me several times. As a iPhone user since the iPhone 3, I purchased this product to essential try the Android ecosystem without breaking the bank. While the Android software is bloated down fairly heavily with this phone, especially considering the very limited internal storage size and storage management system with an SD card (only some/few apps being able to be moved to the SD card and the whole experience of moving those apps to be cumbersome and frustrating), the bloatware is not as bad as it could be. The phone starts at roughly 8 GB and with the android OS taking up 3 GB, you're left with 5 GB which sounds decent but shrinks very fast with the size of current applications and the data that they hold. That being said, this phone runs impressively smooth and certainly usable even under load of switching between several apps. The phone isn't as snappy as say the iPhone 6 (the only phone I have to compare it to) but rightfully so given the incredible price-point of the Moto E compared to a number of other phone and certainly compared to any iPhone. The buttons don't feel as insuring as the snappiness of the device, however, being somewhat loose and responsive enough to get the job done but definitely lacking a satisfying feeling when going to make a button press. The screen is by no means impressive, but it's also not disappointing. It leaves a little to be desired but is sharp enough that things are still somewhat crisp. Another important thing to note (that I wasn't aware of at the time that I purchased this device but soon found is one of the larger disappointments I had in the device) is that the Verizon pre-paid version of this phone cannot be rooted or unlocked to flash a custom ROM. While this certainly isn't a deal-breaker, especially for the people that don't have the technical skill or the ones that are not interesting in the perks of rooting or flashing, being able to root or unlock the phone would add to the value tremendously as it could eliminate the small drawbacks that I did find I had including the storage management, bloatware, and few other odd twerks with settings. The Verizon pre-paid version is one of the only versions of this phone that is carrier locked by my understanding and isn't unlock-able so some research and possibly look into the Sprint or other model/versions of this phone is advised if you wish to take advantage of those things. With all things considered, especially including the absolute steal of a price, this phone is pretty superb for its bracket. It definitely isn't a flagship, but it wasn't designed to be and with that in mind, it is certainly impressive and exceeds expectations in several aspects.",

I have had it two months and it is the slowest smart phone I've ever owned. Today I've had to restart it 4 times because my keyboard keeps disappearing and will not pop up when I need it to type a text. I recommend buying the Moto G instead and I will be purchasing a Moto G as soon as possible.",

            "body": "I picked up this phone for $44.99, which is insanely cheap for a decent Android phone off-contract. The description says that the phone is Verizon pre-paid only-- but that's not true! I put my post-paid SIM card in the phone before turning the phone on for the first time, and it worked without any issues. I bought this phone as a replacement for my current device (this was $100 cheaper than paying for a replacement phone through Assurion). I would recommend this phone for anyone who needs a replacement phone to get them by for a few months until their contract is up for renewal. It's not a top-end phone by any means, but it works well and I'm not missing my old HTC One Max (a phone with far superior hardware). This phone is also running Android 5.0 out-of-the-box. For this price, you're not going to find a better phone-- whether this is a replacement OR your primary phone. [Additionally, you can find ways to use this phone with other carriers (like T-Mobile, ATT, Sprint, etc.) on the XDA-Developers forum. You have to do a little bit of work, but it's definitely worth for the versatility of being able to drop in a SIM card from any carrier.]",

Note THIS CAN BE USED ON VERIZON CONTRACT LINES.....BEFORE YPU TURN ON FOR FIRST TIME SIMPLY PUT YOUR DIM CARD IN PHONE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT SAYS PHONE ALREADY ACTIVATED. I had six months to upgrade and my old lucid 2 could not keep up with new apps. This is great two updates avaliable out of box. 8 gig memory which I had 6 avaliable only a few Verizon apps. Nothing like other Verizon phones. Comes with Verizon text message app. You can get the Motorola one for free. On that point no real tool apps like memo pad or voice record . but that is good for those who don't use. On my old LG 6 apps I can not remove I never used wasted hard drive space. Again on speeker I will use for another week to see if it clears up if not I will get replacement. Love the phone heavy construction feels solid. Like a tank.",

            "body": "I have an iPhone 6 provided from my job but I like to keep my personal phone separate from work. I wanted something on Verizon prepaid and I didn't want to spend a lot. I have to say, I'm really impressed by the moto e. My last phones have been the galaxy s5, the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6. All great phones, but really, at $500-$600 new, they really ought to be. First off, its been awhile since I have experienced android and I have to say it's come a long way. If you are a heavy google user, (maps,chrome, gmail etc) it really is a no brainer to have an android phone. The apple versions of these apps work, but just not as seemlessly and effortlessly. All that aside, this is a $47 phone I'm reviewing. The fact that I use my iPhone 6 next to this and its not awful says it all. Its fast enough for regular use, it loads everything quickly , build quality is pretty standard and solid, battery lasts all day. The places this phone falls short are screen resolution and camera quality. The screen resolution is noticeable against an iPhone but I was less bothered by it than I thought I would be. The camera is probably the only reason I could see myself ever needing more phone than this. That said, if makes me feel more inclined to take pics with my real camera which blows my iPhone away, so maybe not the worst thing. All said I can't say enough about how much I like this phone at this price point. I mean, the case I bought for my iPhone cost me $10 less than this entire phone. Its liberating to know its not the end of the world if something happens to it. Last but not least, I bought a 32gig SD card ( the max the moto e can handle) and increased my storage to 40 gigs for $13. Those constant messages about my storage running low on my iPhone 6 sting just a little bit more these days. Not a perfect phone, but at $47 brand new, if this isn't 5 stars, what is?",

            "body": "This is much better than most of the prepaid phones on the market that you may want to use. I simply let it charge for only 15 minutes to look at the wifi capabilities but it might be better to not turn on the phone at all before you insert a SIM card from a BYOP tracfone program or another carrier. It is really simple if you follow the directions in the tracfone Bring Your Own Phone activation kit and you are good to go. I also did not have any problems at all and my minutes transferred from my old account to the new cell phone within fifteen minutes. Tracfone has much better prices than verizon so I would use the other SIM card kit for the phone and it is totally wrong that it has to be used on the Verizon plan. The only thing that shows now is the Verizon Wireless text in odd places but it just flashes and then goes off quickly. It does not even say \"SIM Card is missing,\" after you turn it off several times and I only disabled the Verizon App and then the SIM Card Toolkit App and it was good to go. I thought I would have to learn some kind of cell phone command language or order an unlock code, but I barely did anything but activate my new SIM card very quickly lol. Updated Review 3 Months After Purchase: For some customers, they might want to add a second user to the phone that lets you have an entire different screen and set of apps. So technically I don't think it lets you add a new user if you did not use Verizon. I have been trying for an hour to download an app on a New User account or even the guest account and it keeps saying there is a connectivity problem that is strange and also does not appear on my regular account. Even more concerning, the account for the new user and the guest also are freezing out of control and have to \"Check connection\" for five minutes every time you try to log in. Sadly this is very unusual for the phone and I believe it is because it tries to look for the Verizon account setup. I think it is overall as the original user much better than an iPhone 4s that has been used for a year for speed, screen size and overall color, and even the phone response to the touch even though I had a life proof cover on the iPhone for the entire span of it and it has never been dropped or cracked. So the original user interface is really wonderful but in comparison the option to add a new user or a guest user is hacked if you are using another network.",

            "body": "I have to say that over the last year or so, Android has finally redeemed itself in my eyes, and the reason for that mostly has to do with Motorola. The Moto G has been an unmitigated top level experience for me so far, so when I found $10 Moto E LTE (Verizon) being blown out by Best Buy during Black Friday, I picked up one. In previous years, you would have been hard pressed to recommend an Android phone for anything under $200. In fact, for my parents, I'd moved them to Lumia phones for that reason: it seemed that for anything with under 2GB of RAM, Android was really sluggish, and had miserable battery life. The Motorola Moto E with 1GB of RAM didn't seem like it would be any better, but for $10 I could have a spare phone. I'm a T-mobile user, so the first thing I did was to follow the instructions to convert the phone to GSM mode. These instructions involved turning the phone into a developer machine, and then using adb to set the wireless radios to talk to the GSM network instead. The penalty is that if you ever switch SIMs (or even pull the SIM out and reboot), the device will revert back into Verizon mode, so this isn't a phone you could expect to travel to various countries and buy local SIM cards with: you'd have to go through the unlock sequence every time you inserted a new SIM card into the device, so unless you're also bringing a laptop with adb installed and are willing to go through it every time you switch SIMs, you're better off buying a truly unlocked phone. Part of the reason Android performance on lower end devices is now acceptable is because hardware has gotten faster. The Moto E LTE has a Snapdragon 410 SoC, which is clocked just 200MHz slower than the one in the Moto G 2015. That 15% disadvantage in clock speed is noticeable, but it's the 1GB of RAM that's really what makes the phone feel less than instantly responsive to your touch. Apps startup just that bit slower, though once started, the apps feel just as fast as on the Moto G. Note, however, that app startup is something you do frequently on Android phones: you click on a link in Gmail, for instance, and startup a web browser. You'd click the share button on the web browser, and then bring up Facebook or Google+ to post. So the performance penalty for task switching really hurts if you're a power user. The camera is decent for taking pictures of receipts and in good light. But without even a flash to help, it's pretty much something you're not going to use and be delighted with. The 4.5\" screen feels like a throwback to 5 years ago: coming from the Moto G, you wonder how anyone ever thought 4.7\" was a decently sized phone, let alone 4.5\". The smaller screen does help with the performance, though: with fewer pixels to push, the device is acceptably fast most of the time. For $10, the phone is definitely a deal. It's more than acceptable, and better than any of the cheap Lumias from past years. For the full retail price of $120, I'd say the Windows Phones start looking better. Fortunately, you'd never have to pay that: the Amazon street price of the phone is around $35, and at that price, I'm think that Windows Phones aren't ever going to be taking market share from Android. The Moto E LTE is a phone that does everything that the higher end devices do acceptably, and with the full range of apps that the windows phones cannot match. I'm now convinced that even supposedly \"thin\" skins such as found on the Sony Xperia phones suck a ton of CPU/GPU power away from UI responsiveness, and that's to be avoided if at all possible, and if you manage to do so, phone hardware is now powerful enough that the Windows phones no longer have an advantage. Recommended. I have to say, if Motorola had been smart enough to make the Moto X Pure waterproof, it would now be in the running for an upgrade: that's how impressive the Moto G has been. Seriously, I have no idea why most of the flagship phones aren't waterproof. It seems like such a basic feature if even a $180 phone can achieve it!",

            "body": "Here is all the smartphone a normal person needs at a very attractive price. I've had a smartphone since the original iPhone S because I am a business user and viewing the internet on the go was a godsend. My litmus test for a phone was and still is whether it works well... its quick, has all the features, etcetera. I don't buy phones as jewelry ... they are tools. I only buy expensive tools if they make sense, and I don't see the advantage to buying an expensive phone if a lower priced phone works for my needs. Two years ago I bought one of the first android phones to reach the $100, and it was a completely different story than this Moto E. It was slow and ran out of memory all the time. It was almost unusable. I ended up replacing it quickly, but I knew the time would come where good phones would drop below that price, and apparently the time is now. Two months ago I bought this phone. Simply put, it is great. Its fast and completely usable for all of my smartphone needs. The battery lasts all day. The case is sturdy and the screen is similar to a high end phone from 2 or 3 years ago. Here is a great personal pocket computer for the price of a dinner for two. The one part of the phone I'm not satisfied with are the cameras. They're okay, but better cameras are what I'll look forward to from an upgrade in the future. For the price, I'm blown away by the value.",

            "body": "I bought this specifically to use as an MP3 player and it is GREAT. I haven't activated phone service so I can't speak to that. I have battled with an iPod Touch and iPad for six years and iTunes is so intuitive I have never figured it out. In less than 72 hours and under $70 total (Moto E, 16 gigabyte micro SD card, and $3.99 paid version of PowerAmp app) I have accomplished what I could never figure out in Appledom: I have imported three flavors of music from a Windows PC: a) iTunes purchases over the Internet; b) Ripped CDs; c) Ancient MP3 files generated from old cassette tapes I owned, using PolderBits software (that was years ago, don't know if it is still available), and organized Playlists based on the file structure from the PC. What Appledom could never never do was recognize the folder structure. So tape A was in a nice little folder with its name and songs labeled \"Track_01\" etc. Tape B was in its little folder with songs labeled \"Track_01\" etc. All the Apple's horses and all the Apple's men could never keep it straight and I always had all the \"Track_01\" jammed together, followed by all the \"Track_02,\" etc. I could manually sort it out but heaven forbid I should sync the iPod again, or update iTunes! With PowerAmp, I can scroll by folders AND THEY ARE THE WAY I ORGANIZED THEM ON THE PC! What a novel concept! Who would ever have thought a person would want the same organization on their MP3 player as on the PC! There are some odd artifacts; mainstream commercial CDs are OK for the most part, but some high school choir CDs and Pimsleur language CDs have odd embedded data which may have come from ripping with iTunes, or from somewhere else. These are all in their own files where I stored them, as near as I can tell, but in the \"folder\" view it seems I can also see them in ghost folders based on whatever is in the hidden attributes. Some of the high school songs are attributed to random commercial artists, and some Pimsleur language files are co-mingled across languages. But I still can go to the original folder from PC and EVERYTHING IS WHERE I PUT IT; the co-mingling is only in the ghost folders. Once the files are loaded, PowerAmp seems a little harder to use than the Apple player - more options, more chances to go wrong. It took me a while to get it to stick to one playlist. There are shuffle options that will jump from list to list and I'm pretty sure I don't understand all I know about it. I haven't yet figured out how to make it display which playlist I'm listening to. I hope I can, that was something I liked about the iPod. Back to the phone itself, I do notice that the cover art is not as crisp on this phone as on the iPhone, but I don't listen with my eyes. If you are buying the phone as a phone and the display is important to you, this is a step down from an expensive phone. However even with my trifocals I can read all the text I need for navigating through my music. The speaker on the phone is pretty good - better than my old iPod Touch and at least as good as my company-issued iPhone 6 - and it sounds great to me plugged into my desktop speakers. But I don't pretend to be an audiophile. I'm not saying anything bad about the sound, I'm saying I don't have the ear to tell. It is loud enough to listen to talk recordings riding around in my pocket while I do chores. I haven't tried it with headphones. The FM radio tuner is decent but it only works when something is plugged into the headphone jack; the cable is the antenna. I have played with the Internet over WiFi a little. When I'm doing one thing at a time it seems every bit as fast as the iPhone 6, on the same WiFi signal. I haven't activated the phone service so I don't know how it would be accessing the Web over a cell signal. Also I have not tried browsing the Web with other apps running in the background. After spending an hour or more organizing playlists, and playing external speakers for 7 hours and the built in speaker for another couple of hours, the battery indicator looks like it is still about 2/3 full. The first day it seemed to drain faster but after a long overnight charge it is working great.",

            "body": "Don't waste your money with this cheap piece of junk. There's a reason Motorola is going under. Bad products, bad management, bad customer service and bad company policies. This junk almost immediately began to have problems with the microphone. At first I assumed it was something to do with my signal thinking no way something that LOOKS so nice could actually be such a piece of junk. Sure enough, after two months of seldom use the microphone finally gave out. I tried blowing it out with canned air and even doing a factory reset, but nope. Fortunately I purchased a protection plan for it when I bought it at Chinamart but all they did was give me the number for Motorola. The man in India whom I had to repeat my name five times to and still insisted my first name was really my last name told me that if I sent them $125.00 dollars they would then send me a new phone which I'd probably receive in about a month's time (being it was India) and then after I sent them my old phone back (another month) he would then reimburse me $100.00 dollars. I paid $60.00 for it at Chinamart. Don't waste your time with any product made at the soon to be out of business Motorola Corp. unless you like to contribute to some obese CEO's golden parachute. UPDATE: After finally giving in and sending the phone to get repair it was sent back but lasted about a month before issues with the battery draining and the phone boot looping began. Apparently, from what one of the salesmen at Verizon told me is that Motorola has been having problems with many of their phones batteries malfunctioning. Supposedly this issue has been cleared up with their latest models but there never was a recall on all the bad models. So I have sent the phone back a second time to be repair. Whether they fix it is another issue. Needless to say I will never buy Motorola again.",

            "body": "This is a nicely built, decently spec'd entry-level device. I decided I would try one at Best Buy, on their 14 day trial period, to see if it would make a good replacement or back-up phone for the Motorola Luge (Razr M) I've been using for the last three months on Verizon's pre-paid plan. The first thing I noticed about it was that it was MUCH more difficult to customize than the Luge was. I'm not sure if it was the new Lollipop OS, or the proprietary Moto stuff, or the pre-loaded Google Launcher, but it wouldn't correctly run any of the notification reminder apps in the play store (I have found them to be essential for not missing calls and text messages), or my beloved Moto Circles widget. In addition, they kind of force you to merge all of your email accounts into the Gmail app on this thing, and it was very hard to figure out how to keep my email accounts separate, the way I like them, and still get notifications of them as they arrive. On top of that, it doesn't come with a stock video player, forcing you to download and install a 3rd party app if you don't want to use the limited gallery app to watch videos. I was also surprised to find a 5MP camera with limited zoom ability and no auto focus, when my Razr M (a year older phone) came with an 8MP one with great zoom and auto-focus, and the front-facing camera for selfies on this thing was a joke. In keeping with all the other disappointments, even with what they call a \"1.2 GHz QUAD core processor\" in this Moto E 2nd Gen, it was no faster than my 1.5 GHz DUAL-core Razr M. In fact, my Razr M located me, drew the map and started navigation faster than the Moto E did, and everything I looked up on both devices came in just as quickly on the Razr M, or faster, than it did on the Moto E. I DID like the way Lollipop stays active with Google Now and the \"OK Google\" thing while you're on the home screen, but apparently any phone running the new Android OS does that, so this ONE better thing about this phone certainly wasn't enough to justify the $69.99 price when I only paid $49.99 for the Razr M, so I returned it within the 14 day grace period and will continue to enjoy my Motorola Luge until they come out with something considerably better around this price. This cute little Moto E was a real disappointment compared to the Luge, or my other device, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom (which I LOVE as a fantastic camera that also works pretty nicely as a phone on AT&T's MUCH poorer network). Bottom line? If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive entry-level phone and haven't fallen in love with certain things about your current phone (like the cool Circles Widget, Notification Reminders, LED notification capability, decent camera, stock video app, etc., etc., etc.) you might just find this phone to your liking, especially at this $69.99 price on Verizon's INCREDIBLE network and very reasonably priced, pre-paid plans.",

            "body": "Hardware Design; the phone feels and looks good. The textured removable edge and the matte black rear of the phone feel good to hold. A small dimple at the Motorola logo helps you to keep a good grip on the phone. This is actually one of the nicest feeling phones I have ever held, it fits in my hands well and its easy to grip one handed and touch every part of the screen. The visual aesthetics are well thought out too, there are no visible slots for sim or SD and the phone is entirely black. Its nearly symmetrical except for the power button and the volume up/dn which are both on the right side. The power button has a texture which helps you know you are pressing what you want. There are no other physical buttons.The headphone port is centered on the top of the phone. There is no text on the exterior of the device, but the Motorola, Verizon, and 4G LTE logos are all on the back. A black rubberized ring wraps the outer edge of the phone, you can snap this off to reveal the micro SD card slot, the SIM card slot and the tag that is on a little pull label (this was seriously unexpected and kind of fun). The battery is non-removable. It charges via micro USB. Battery: I dont use the phone that much, but I go through maybe 40-50% in a day. Unless you are using it constantly, it should last most people a full day. Camera: Barely useable. Works fine outside on a sunny day, but indoors you get very grainy blurry photos. It doesn't focus very well. Selfie-cam, forget it. If the back facing camera is bad, the front one is terrible. OS and Software: The OS is Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. It's not as good as Jelly Bean or Kit Kat but because this is a Motorola phone you can hope that updates will come quickly. Motorola and Verizon have some bloatware, but its not acceptable. Verizon Messages is surprisingly good. Comes with an FM radio app. All email now goes through Gmail; which takes some getting used to. The Camera and Gallery apps are as bad as the hardware. Seriously, if you need a proper camera phone, this is not for you. For under $100 unlocked, this is a good deal, its likely that it will hold its value for quite a while on the second hand market.",

If you're like me and are a deep sleeper, this alarm will auto-snooze for you. I've almost missed a few very important events because of this phone.

Twice, I had trouble getting the phone to answer a call, and when the audio finally connected, it was at earsplitting volume. Because both these occurred while answering, it was annoying enough that I don't exactly remember the sequence. I refuse to experiment to pin down the sequence that would allow me to reproduce the problem because I refuse to risk damage to my hearing. My ears are still buzzing from the last time, and will go to the doctor if it doesn't clear soon. (And i live in the city and am not finicky about noise) 2. The bluetooth system doesn't reliably connect -- and this may be be related to problem No. 1. This is bluetooth headset I've used with another cheap prepay phone from another carrier without issue. 3. The software has a serious problem in the phone app. The dialer icon often sits over a contact either in Speed dial tab or in the recent calls tab. But I often use to the dialer to punch in numbers and tapping the dialer icon often dials the number under the icon while at the same time raising the dialer keypad. It's a software problem and I suspect this is Verizon at work, but it could be Google and the constantly changing android interfaces. Anyway, I can cope with this by keeping the speed dial as clear as possible, so the the dialer icon is isolated. When I went to the Verizon storefront, I got a snotty clerk, who found it necessary to tell me, \"This is a smartphone and you got to learn to use it.\" So Verizon has picked my pocket one time, but I'd never sign up for a regular plan with the company.",

            "body": "This phone is simply an updated 1st gen Moto G (identical size, shape, feel, buttons) but with a serious flaw: the call quality is terrible. Really terrible. Why? This isn't a real phone most of the time, it forces you to call with \"HD calling\" - better known as VOIP. Every call sounds like you are in Skype... possibly across a major ocean. And because it uses the data connection, you can't use data while you are in the phone, and drops the call every time you lose LTE.. welcome back to 2006. There is no way to turn off this \"feature\" or more broadly to turn off LTE without rooting the phone. Simply put, it's a terrible phone. If you don't use your phone for.. well.. phone calls, it could be a good fit for the price, features, etc. Other than that, \"HD Calling\" kills what could have been a good budget phone.",

            "body": "I selected a seller offering a used model in \"Very Good\" condition for $49.95 (JP Mobiles LLC) and, like many reviewers, ended up with a carrier locked phone. But the seller had me the unlock code within a day of me contacting them, and all is well. The handset arrived bubble-wrapped in a generic box with a mini USB charging cable and a Samsung plug adapter. All worked fine and were in excellent condition. The handset looks like a new out-of-the-box piece with no blemishes and functions perfectly. The Lumia 635 looks better in person than in pictures with its Gorilla Glass face and black shell. It has no physical buttons, so the entire face is just the glass and the edge of the rear shell. Sitting on my desk, it looks like a fine piece of tinted glass, uniformly dark. Even the NOKIA logo is barely visible. It attracts fingerprints easily, but they wipe off just as easily. Really nice looking. It's larger than an iPhone 5S but probably a tiny bit smaller than an iPhone 6. I really like the Windows Phone UI. It's easily and broadly customizable and flows well. I really like how I can add tiles not just to programs, but to specific pages. I have four MSN Weather tiles set at the top of my feed for four different cities, so when I open the main screen, I can see the current temperature for each city immediately. There are negatives. Screen resolution and the processor are mid-tier quality at best. There are far better camera phones out there. My car radio won't recognize it and play music when plugged into the USB port. App support is terrible, of course, but Facebook and Twitter are on board. I'm using the handset as a secondary test phone at work, so that's all fine, but this phone could never be my daily driver. If your data usage is limited to Facebook, Twitter, and web browsing, this is a fine handset available at a tremendous value compared to Android and Apple products. And you'll have something that stands out over your friends' handsets.",

            "body": "I'm in LOVE with the camera on this phone! Pictures don't come out fuzzy even when you crop or zoom in, it automatically focuses pretty darn good with \"close-ups\"! I use it a lot with taking many pictures of items for sale on Ebay. But I don't know what's wrong with the \"phone\" and windows? I keep buying this phone just because of the CAMERA and just needing a simple \"phone\" and it works great for about 6 months and issues begin to happen. Right now the message feature will lock up after one word, so my messages to be able to send Iwouldneedtowriteitlikethis all together without spaces to be able to send it. The battery charge is only lasting like 3-5hrs when it use to last all day and the voice is sometimes not able to understand, either intermittent seconds of cut off or sounding muzzled but I don't know if that's the service or the phone. The camera feature is now locking up sometimes... This phone would be \"too good to be true\" if it would just last longer! The camera feature does work amazing for a long time until now over a year. I'd give it a 5+ star for the first 6 months of working great but it's just too good to be true, for it starts to die after that and it's why I gave it a 2 star. I'm already looking at other cellphones again but trying them out always brings me back to considering to buying this one AGAIN for a 3rd time! =( There's NOTHING out there that can compare, maybe if I put insurance on it, I can keep trading in for a new one every 6 months? IDK, this is so frustrating!",

It is fast, responsive, and sleek. Has a nice, \"real\" feel in hand. Again, very surprising purchase. But (and this will frighten you), this phone did not come factory reset. It was synced to a user's email, revealing their banking information, name, LinkedIn job searches, and so on. Very scary. The Internet can be a dangerous place when your personal information is available this easy. Note to Amazon (who fulfilled the order), and the seller: You need to be very careful when selling Window's devices that have not been factory reset -- or any device for that matter. Had we been different people, we could have ruined this poor person's life all because of your negligence.",

It arrived on time, worked as expected and I have suffered no issues since having it. Disclaimer: I have dropped it a few times. It still works dependably and I haven't seen any mechanical errors yet. The windows phone operating system is great. It compliments my windows tablet very well and has a cozy design. The features are easy to find and there's rarely endless and confusing sub-menus like iphones. Minor complaints: It doesn't seem to dim enough at night when I'm using it in the dark or brighten enough on the sunniest southern summer days. The screen came with a very small area that was scratched and the screen seems to scratch somewhat easily, but is still very easy to view. I'll probably buy Nokia phones from now on",

            "body": "Can't get much better than this for a budget phone. Fast and smooth with a quad core. Not many phones out there with quad cores at this price. Memory was 512mb and listed as being expandable but further research indicates you wouldn't want to expand onto an SD card as it would become slower. That was my original intention, but it runs smoothly with 512mb of RAM and doesn't need an upgrade (I'm also not one to play graphic heavy games on my phone as I'll leave that for my desktop). File system is not quite the same as android. For each file windows associates that file with a program and won't show up in file searches. I added music files to the phone and wanted to add them as ringtones, but found I had to do a bit of a workaround to get my own custom ringtones on there. Msft provided steps to do it and it worked out just fine (just not as convenient as android). Battery life is good and goes about 2 days -2.5 days and I play a lot of candy crush. Camera is \"Okay\". No camera on front, but for what I use it for, I don't need one (don't do video chats or take selfies). I upgraded to windows 10 but couldn't stand it and reverted back to windows 8. Cortana didn't work and forced to move towards the outlook app which was inconvenient with 2 emails. Also found Windows 10 browser didn't run as smoothly as the windows 8 version and things just were not intuitively simple (i.e. where my fingers wanted to go was not where they had to go). Having gone back to windows 8.1 I'm loving it again and love the customization of times and layout of email.",

Great battery life and it's a durable phone. I will say this model is starting to not support the newest windows phone software though because it is an older model.

It is half the size and inexpensive enough for him to replace as regularly. He did cut the amount of apps he installs on his phone to optimize speed. He still continues to lose or drop his phone.

Battery life is at least 2-3 days with limited internet/apps usage/e reader usage. Note: this did not include videos or games so cannot offer details regarding battery life usage using these (yet). Using phone on a Straighttalk plan and only some issues with outgoing text attachments not being received by other phone subscribers (t-mobile).

            "body": "I purchased this phone for my 14 year old niece who was using a pre-paid tracphone. Like many teenagers, it took her about 3.5 seconds to learn all there was to learn to use the phone like a pro. She was already texting by the time I had my phone turned on. She liked the smaller size and found the windows operating system to be very easy to use. I showed her where she could get additional apps and she seemed pretty pleased with the variety. This phone worked right out of the box and once the sim card was added, she was off and running. Great beginner phone for the money.",

I need a basic smartphone for work: text messaging, phone, email and calendaring as critical. Occasional Spotify and podcasts. For the price you really cannot beat this. Yes, the screen is somewhat dim, the hardware specs are pretty low, but again, look at the price. I used to have a Lumia 920, 820 and now this 635. Setup was easy, simply replace SIM as I did, or swap one out of the old phone as indicated by the AT$T store. Cheers!",

We bought two of these from different sellers. One to get my spouse a working and text capable phone again, and the second when we saw how well it worked.

Multiple service calls with CC since they are the only ones with whom I can speak have yielded nothing. I can do everything with this phone except MMSC messaging. After many settings changes, resets (my phone and with CC) nothing works. The forums are awash in others with the same problem and with various claims of success which all don't agree with each other. Many statements of \"these are the settings that work\" but disagreement reigns. Some commenters are ready to set fire to Microsoft or somebody others to give their phones back. Nobody seems to implicate AT&T whose network is being used. So great phone but unless you have some magic pixi dust, a service like I have will prevent you from enjoying MMSC and grandkid photos. Have to use email instead.",

I would recommend removing the protector as well as the easily removed plastic sheet that protects the screen during shipping; .... and of course ordering a quality screen protector for the lumia 635.",

One criticism is that the applications are of a very \"proprietary nature\" so that only those allowed by Windows may be installed. I wish there were more freedom of choice other than the app store provided. Also, if one is on a limited budget (prepaid) then you will want to switch-off many of the apps as these require minutes. So far, the Nokia Lumia 635 meets expectations. It did ship, on time and set-up was easy after I requested configurations settings from my network carrier.",

However compared to the much more expensive and feature loaded 920, this 635 has turned out to be the better phone: this immediately recognized my home wifi network. When I put the SIM card in from Consumer Cellular, I was immediately able to make calls. Cortona worked the first time I set it up. The screen is bright, the signal is strong and so far I am pleased ! The 920 is another story: no wifi connection at my house, did not recognize my SIM card (this is a HUGE problem per Google) and even after downloading updates on my neighbor's wifi, still no Cortona despite 8.1 being downloaded. I gave up and am returning it. So I bought another 635 as my backup phone. Hope it works as well as the first one I have !",

With this, the sound is great at mid volume, the speaker is clear and it is easy to use. It has features that I wasn't expecting and would rather pay for this phone than buy the jacked up prices other phones cost. The battery is long. I can go a few days without charging and I don't need to worry about playing a movie on it and then find a place to charge it. I also like the Windows base instead of Android or Apple. I wish the Windows version was closer to the laptop windows version, but close enough that I can use the same files. I bought a case for it and I have people asking me what brand it is.

            "body": "I bought (helped her purchase with her card) this for my 71 year old mom, who has used a Windows phone for years and fully understands how they work. She was excited to get a new one. However, it's been a horrible phone and a waste of money. It's \"open\" but really NOT. It doesn't work well with TMobile, it has preloaded stuff on it that is causing problems. She's on limited income and NEEDS A REFUND!!! She tried so hard to make it work, she went past the 1 month return policy but I feel if she doesn't get a FULL REFUND she's being taken advantage of and I will keep complaining. I have a 635, same phone, I bought it at a Microsoft store and it was truly \"unlocked.\" (3 years ago, appx). Mine and hers are NOTHING alike. Hers is a mess, confusing, has weird apps. The Cortana which she loved to use isn't functioning much at all. The GPS directions feature has failed her and she's been lost trying to get to see her grandkids play sports games around the metro. The T-Mobile people are saying she needs to throw it out and get a better phone. But I have one and it's working fine. It's the product that this seller sold us that is the problem.",

The phone has only 512 MB of RAM but is pretty responsive none the less. No visible lag so far. Other than that Windows 10 is fun to use and I can do almost anything I could do with my Android phone.",

The writing is extremely small and very light I am unable to read from pages 2-22 so it has been a challenge for me to get familiar with the instructions in a timely manner. I got an email from the Good Guys about my comments stating they wanted positive feedback. As previous stated this 635 Lumia is extremely difficult to use without proper instruction from a guide that is impossible to read. I am not happy with this purchase.",

Fortunately, my brother-in-law had this phone and needed to switch carriers, so he gave us his Lumia 635. She has been using it now for four or five months with absolutely no problems. The build is light but not flimsy, the performance is quick, the camera takes acceptable pictures (so long as you have good lighting), and it does absolutely everything that my wife was doing with her iPhone 4S... with one exception: the lack of a camera FLASH. For my wife, this is a pretty big sore spot, because she likes using her phones' flash as a flashlight. She has told me repeatedly that were it not for this issue, she would have zero issues with this device. If lack of a flash (and flashlight) mean little to you, then this is a no-brainer. If you DO want a flash and better specs, the newer Lumia 640 (this phone's replacement) is better-equipped, but costs a bit more.",

            "body": "I got this phone for my son who's going to Europe this summer. He's had a regular phone on our Verizon family plan but, after some investigation, I found out that their international plan is ridiculous. So...I researched the GoPhone, found out he can just exchange the sim card for one he can purchase in each country he visits, and decided to give it a try. I figured if it didn't work out, I was only out $46. The phone arrived in two days, fully packaged (that assured me it wasn't used or refurbished). It comes with a sim card so all you have to do is call and activate it and they give you your new phone number. We decided to try it out for a few days just to be sure he was going to like it before we dropped his phone from Verizon and ported his old number. He absolutely loves it! He keeps saying he can't believe it's a $46 phone! The speed that it loads videos and music is better than my iphone and the call clarity is great! The live tiles are cool, too, and the expandable memory (with a memory card) is going to be great for taking lots of travel pictures. It even has an FM radio which is unique in this day and age. After getting his seal of approval, we decided to drop him from our contract and port his old number. A ten minute phone call and he was good to go. This was, by far, the easiest cell phone experience I've ever had! Side note.....I've had to call AT&T a few times for various things (setting up the phone, porting his old number, and questions about oversees calling.....basic \"newbie\" things) and I cannot begin to tell you how awesome their customer service is! The people are easily understood, very friendly, and my longest wait was when they ported the old number and I had to stay on the line while we waited for the Verizon operator to do what he needed to do (rolling my eyes). A few things to note: This phone cannot be used with Verizon. If you pay for unlimited data, be aware that it slows down considerably after you've used your 1.5GB. You can still use the data (or wifi, of course) but streaming videos on data is just about impossible at the slower speed. Take care to use wifi as much as possible and it won't be an issue. There is no flash to the camera (which I really don't understand) or front facing camera so selfies will have to be done in bright light with a mirror and skype might be difficult (this doesn't bother my son because he's not a \"selfie guy\" and he can skype with his laptop). The one thing he found that he wishes he had is more app selections. They're quite limited in comparison to others but It's not enough of an issue to dislike the phone. If you're on the fence about this one, I say go for it! I am so happy I didn't listen to my husband about how prepay is a pain and more expensive. That's simply not true! When my son leaves for Europe, I just won't buy anything for his phone while he's gone and pick back up when he returns. With Verizon, we'd be paying for a service he couldn't use. Also, we can adjust his plan to meet his needs. If he needs more data, we simply buy more for a month. Then, when he starts paying for his own phone, if he can't afford data, he can drop it to talk and text only and just use Wifi when he needs internet. There are just so many options, it seems silly to be under contract.",

            "body": "As a basic, everyday phone for calls/texting I would give this a 5. It does as expected to that effect, speaker can be decently loud,good for music/YouTube. The cons:(not all these will matter if just want a basic smartphone) on screen keyboard is small and you WILL inadvertently miss type things I promise, no flash for camera(also means no flashlight app),speaking of apps...this is a windows phone...so nothing from Google play works on this (you think that would be common sense considering its not Android but still tried just to make sure). You still get fb and Twitter. No chrome or Firefox you are stuck with internet explorer. Cortana works decently and for some reason understands voice input (corrects better) than if you are voice texting. I have owned this phone for 1 month and recently it has begun to lockup in the middle of youtube(screen goes black)but you can still hear the audio, and can only be remedied by holding the per button until it shuts off and then reset the battery. Again, as a basic cheap possibly entry level smartphone this thing is pretty nice, do not expect its features to outshine a higher end phone",

Of course the seller flatly denied the situation could be how I described, so I had to point out to him that I was keeping the phone but that he needed to be aware of the product that he was selling, and I was helping him and there was no need to be arrogant and stupid.",

It has now been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 which has a large five inch screen, dual front and back cameras, 4g LTE for high speed data, and a long life battery.

In December, the 640 will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available. The many 635 owners who have upgraded to the 640 are very, very happy.",

Through out using this phone there is absolutely nothing wrong with it Nokia did well making it, but the problem with this phone is the fact that it is a windows phone which means it doesn't have anywhere close to the usefull apps the appstore or the playstore would have. For example Snapchat and YouTube ect. When buying this phone this should weigh in your decision whether to get the Nokia lumia 635. If your looking for a cheap smartphone an match up to an iPhone or galaxy s4 or one of those phones I recomend boy product smartphones. Other that I loved the Nokia lumia 635 I found cortana extremely useful and helpful thru out the small time period I had this phone. I hoped this helped anyone that is looking to purchase this phone or any low priced smartphone in general.",

I've had my 1st S6 Edge since October 2015 and not quite two years later in August 2017 I just bought this 2nd one for my wife a few weeks ago. Glad I did. I sure wish manufacturers would put quality FIRST versus trying to out do the other guy with more bells and whistles or stupid ideas that THEY think WE want / need.",

            "title_review": "A good choice for the price (on Amazon)!",
            "body": "This phone is beautiful! It really is cool looking and sleek. The black sapphire looks sparkly blue in the light. REALLY pretty! However, it is VERY slippery in the hand. I was so nervous I'd drop it in the 24 hours before my case arrived ( Galaxy S6 Edge case, E LV Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (SHOCK PROOF DEFENDER) Slim Case Cover - Impact Protection **NEW**[Black] Ultimate protection from drops and impacts for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge [BLACK / BLACK ])! I've had the phone for 2 weeks now and all of the functions it advertises work. I'm still figuring some of them out and had the price not been so good on Amazon, I wouldn't have sprung for the edge. The notifications and people functions are cool, but totally unnecessary. The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up to work with multiple fingers (up to 4) and works very well. The backup password is more secure than a typical 4 digit code (had to be at least 8(?) characters),though I haven't had any problems opening the phone with my fingerprint. The heart rate monitor is really cool. I've been checking it at various times of the day and it's cool to see how low (or high!) your heart rate is. Overall, the response to using apps and web pages is fast. It loads webpages really quickly, email was easy to set up and my gmail and hotmail accounts are easy to access from the same icon and I can switch between them with a simple swipe. My work email loads quickly and works as expected as well. The way the email system is set up, it allows you to swipe right or left to get to the next or previous message which I've found rather convenient. So far, the battery is great! I've been warned against \"over charging\" so I never leave it charging overnight, as I did my previous phone. The fast charging is really super-fast. I'd say it gets a full charge in less than 2 hours. I've charged in the evening prior to going to bed, stopped it at 95% and it was still around 20% the following night with moderate to heavy use (no gaming/video streaming, just talk, text, email, web-surfing). The camera does take very clear shots of stable scenes. Haven't played with the settings or different modes at all yet. Straight auto shooting of moving kids haven't always been clear, but that's more likely due to user error than the fault of the camera. Unless this is also user-error (I haven't looked into it yet) I cannot seem to take a picture directly from a text message. With my old phone I could go into a group message, take a picture and have it automatically attach to the message. If this phone allows that, it isn't an obvious feature. Ditto for simply attaching an existing picture to a message. I have to go into the gallery, pick the picture, add the recipients, and then write a message to send it. Again, this might be a function I haven't figured out yet, but it shouldn't be rocket science to do this. There's usually a little paper clip somewhere in the messaging app that allows attachments. Not so on this phone. I bought a tempered glass protector, but it made it very difficult for the phone to recognize my touch. I ended up removing it as I was too frustrated by it. That may a problem of the protector I chose ( S6 Edge Screen Protector, AOKDO [Full Screen Coverage] Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (clear) ) rather than the phone, but my screen is currently naked and I am worried about it breaking as it seems pretty fragile. I will say it is a bit glitchy at times even without the screen protector. I have had issues with it not responding to my touch when I try to scroll up/down or open an application. Not often enough to make me want to return it, but annoying none the less (especially since I chose this phone over another due to the frequency of complaints on reviews of the other phone for this exact issue). I'm hoping it doesn't get worse over time. There is a system update pending, but I haven't allowed it without doing a little research. Maybe that will fix the issue. I believe this is more of a Verizon complaint than specific to the phone, but you cannot do anything else on the phone while speaking to someone. You can't use mobile data to send a text message, use an app, use google maps to get directions, or look something up on the web if you're using the phone/calling function. I read that this is true of all new Verizon phones, but annoying none the less. Overall, I do like the phone a lot. I'd say there are a lot of features that make this a great phone. The minor irritations are just that: minor. All in all a good choice for the price!",

The edge designs feels great in your hand, however, the integration in to the software and functionality is very limited. The edge screen helps create shortcuts to your favorite apps, top contacts and even allows you to set up shortcuts to execute certain tasks. The battery is not as strong as that of the Samsung Galaxy S6 (non-Edge) but I guess that is the trade off for visual design and feel. The functionality of the light up edge screen based off preset contacts is useful however not a true necessity.",

            "body": "*The S6 Edge is one of the most unique phones on the market. Instead of the Note Edge having one edged screen, the S6 version has 2. That means that the normal screen is all screen, there will be no notification drops; all of them are displayed at the side.* *Just a quick disclaimer: I just got this phone today at BestBuy and Ive been playing with it for a lot of time nonstop. So far the experience is great and nearly perfect. I encountered no stutters, no lag, no glitches, nothing. I downloaded a couple graphically intensive games and it ran all of them very well. And all in all navigating through the Touchwiz UI was surprisingly smooth, something that I wish I could've complimented in the past Samsung phones. Right now the battery is at 31 percent for me.* Oh god this phone is a masterpiece. Let me just start out by saying that I've had the S5 for about 6 months now. I've mostly liked the phone. I liked it's dependable battery life, it's water and dust resistance, it's gorgeous display, etc. But I felt like some things about it were just a deal breaker. The Touchwiz UI was no better than looking in a trash can. It was slow to respond and had these peculiar bleeps and bloop sounds that were rather annoying than adding something convenient. The air gestures were dope to use first but it quickly got useless. The settings were a total mess and it left a sour taste to a myriad of users including me. I'm most defenitely not the person who will hate any phone because it is made out of plastic and love the other because it has metal, but I did like a well built phone. It's not like I would hate a plastic phone but the S5 did have a better design than the S4, but it still wasn't good. It was an improvement but not one that I loved holding instantly when I picked it up unlike HTC phones. All in all, the S5 wasn't for everyone. Then I saw this phone at MWC 2015. I didn't go the the event but I did watch some videos of this phone at the event. I saw that the S6 had better design, it was made out of glass, it had no expandable storage or battery replacement option, the Touchwiz UI was less \"Touchweezy\" and much cleaner and faster, it had much better specs inside, and there was an S6 edge version. I knew that the S6 was a phone that I've wanted from Samsung long time but I had to experience it firsthand to believe it. So I brought this phone Day 1 from Best Buy, and I have to say, this phone is almost everything that I've wished for. Pros: -Very premium to hold. There is actual metal around the edges, not just shiny plastic and the back is made out of glass, just like the Nexus 4. -The display is the best out of any phone in the market at the moment (4/10/15). Samsung upgraded the display from 1080p to 1440p. This makes it sharper and clearer, but you won't notice the difference that much side by side unless you look close. Also, in traditional Samsung fashion, the phone has great colors, excellent contrast ratio, etc. -Touchwiz UI is cleaner and better than ever. The whole UI seems fast and fluid, especially since it's running on Android 5.0 Lollipop. Some of the features like Air Gesture are no longer there in the settings. It looks flatter. -Great performance. Samsung ditched Qualcomm for their processors in their phone now and they decided to put their well known Exynos processor inside this phone. They also put 3 GB of DDR4 Ram now. The result is a beastly phone that does almost anything you throw at it. Graphically intensive games run very well even at high settings and everyday tasking is smooth. Runs like a beast. -Very fast to charge. I had the battery at 21% and charged it for 30 minutes and it instantly went up to 93%. -Camera has less noise on low light pictures and there is OIS now. Cons: -Not IP67, meaning its not dust proof or water resistant. It would've been nice if they still kept that extra protection from the S5 to this phone, but I haven't dropped a phone in the water for nearly a decade, so this isn't a huge problem for me. -Battery is not replacable. Its quite a sad thing for Samsung to cut down, since most of their old phones had this feature. If your battery is dead, then too bad, you have to either go to an Electronics support store and get it fixed or buy a new phone. Luckily, a phone's battery life R.I.P's after 2 or 3 years, so its a long lifespan. -No SD Card Storage. This is what bugs me and this is why Im quite confused why Sammy left this feature out. The HTC One M9 has an SD Card storage. Is it made out of plastic? No. The glass back on the S6 is perfectly capable of adding a storage slot to expand memory. Thankfully the base line of the S6 has 32GB, which is adequate for most people.",

            "body": "I had a S6. Went to put a memory card in it, but Samsung skipped that version, so instead, I had to download all of my pictures,etc., because it ran so slow (was pretty full). Battery life was so so, I just charged it anytime I was near my charger to ensure it didn't quit. This was imperative as I ran an application that tracked blood sugars for diabetes and was always running down. Open a game, and it went to zero. The annoyance of having to go into my phone app and click on voice calls only so I could clear out the calls EACH time was beyond my understanding. Why it didn't allow the filter to stay on my choice, but default to all text messages and calls says poor attention to engineering to me, esp. from your users perspective. Finally, after a couple of years (I'm not one to change cars or phones every six months), I accidentally dropped the phone into water. I immediately removed it, but when I looked on the net to see how I could open the back to dry out the components (it was still trying to work) and saw I had to have a heat gun, a guitar pick, a couple of playing cards and a suction cup tool, I gave up. Needless to say, it died. Meanwhile, my sister has stayed with another Korean competitor, has dropped her phone many times on the ground and in water, and has been able to still use it. For the cost of these new phones, I'll never buy this manufacturer again (ask me about their dryers!). Decent graphics and the camera was ok.",

            "body": "Speaking from someone who enjoys using new technology and an Android lover, I'm not certain if this is an advancement from the S5, but then again I didn't own the S5 (just was not drawn to it or impressed by the possibility of it - I opted for the LG G3), while the last flagship iteration of the Galaxy S series I last owned was the S3 in 2012 (flagship maker for Samsung's Galaxy S series). The S3 was a great phone, but it was plagued by battery life like most other Android phones at that time. To the present 2015-2016, after a month of usage, my impression is clearer. Between the S3 and S6, it's a mixed bag of advancement and drawbacks. First obvious is the lack of removable back and expandable memory. Why Samsung would go away from one of the significant reason I appreciated the Android flagship and sway towards the \"wanna be\" likeness with Apple, I don't know. From me to Samsung, listen to your users and stay true. I bought this phone honestly out of curiosity to answer that very question. Why the unibody? My answer? After a month of use, I do find this phone quite enjoyable to use, call quality, voice and music sound quality is exceptional with APT-X built in -- it's noticeable, compared to the Note 3 & 4, the S6 Edge is a great improvement in overall sound experience - via bluetooth and aux cable. The super AMOLED display does not disappoint. This phone and future phones in my opinion threaten to cannibalize it's own manufacturer's tablet sales market. As I currently own the Samsung 9.7 LTE Tab S2 and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition Tablet, I find myself using this phone to browse, shop, surf, check email, etc, more so than my tablets. I find the one handed usage with the high resolution of this AMOLED display to be ample and pleasant. What type of user am I? I use this phone for it's Bluetooth music listening, voice calls, email checking, apps craigslist/ebay/amazon shopping, mobile banking, YouTube streaming (although I have Netflix, Crackle and Prime, my Verizon data plan limit my freedom of data usage, that's another beef I won't go into detail), and email checking. I connect to the LG Tone Ultra headsets for voice and music (another great product). I also actively own and use the Note 5 concurrently with this phone. And I have to admit the Note 5 experience is much more smooth and fluid than the S6 Edge, but because the size of this phone in my hand feels more relaxed and natural, I lean towards the S6 Edge (longing for the Note 5 fluid and smoothness). Why S6 Edge versus the regular S6, or waiting just a few more weeks for the S7 release? Because I knew that the S7 will not have the 5.1 inch version of the Edge. The S7 offering is only the 5.1 inch non-edge and S7 Edge 5.5 bigger version similar to S6 Edge plus. I like the 5.1 inch size with the Edge capabilities. I enjoy the Edge on the 5.1 inch screen which naturally fits in my hand while offering the unique market differentiating look and feel of the Edge design and features. What I find lacking in the S6 Edge is the battery life and compared to the Note 5, the smoothness and fluid performance. with that said, Samsung has convinced me I don't need the removable back cover or expandable memory with 32GB of storage. Now for the battery life, it needs help, Starting my day at 5am, by 8am I'm already at 50% with general usage and mostly on idle time. The S6 Edge is a wall hugger, which is shameful at this stage of the game. Surprisingly the S6 has the same battery life behavior as the S3. That's not a compliment. What makes it tolerable is quick charging which is somewhat the saving grace and the Edge innovation. I do have the Incipio black case and Military Shield screen protector installed, which dramatically enhances my experience and hand confidence greatly. I highly recommend this combination of pairing. Bottom-line: I could give it 5 stars because you will enjoy the premium engineering and build of this phone. It's rich - naturally non-fatigue hand held usage (properly paired with the right screen protector and case), APT-X digital quality sound, voice calls with no complaints, high resolution 2k Super Amoled screen (brilliantly eye pleasing), unique and innovative Edge design and features, all positive advancements. I give props to Samsung for convincing me I don't need the removable back and expandable memory, but the shameful and appalling poor battery life is just disappointing, downright unforgivable, while the software speed and smoothness just isn't quite as refined as the Note 5 or even more surprisingly my old LG G3. I imagine the S7 will be a great phone -- which to me is like the dream team of features, disappointingly, I may not hop on it, since the S7 lacks the Edge offer on a 5.1 inch version. What the S7 release allows the market to do is still value this phone as relevant since it's the only 5.1 inch Edge offer from Samsung until possibly the S8.",

            "body": "Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S6 Edge is a smartphone that gives you optimal performance and a beautifully crafted design. Essentially, this device has the same specifications as its brother-device, the Galaxy S6, so performance wise you can\u2019t go wrong with either. What distinguishes the S6 Edge from its counterpart, of course, is the new Dual-Edge design, which has such features as a Night Clock, Edge Lighting (for special contacts when they call) and the People\u2019s Edge, which keeps your top 5 contacts readily available (like speed dial) on the edge-screen. Also, when compared to the new IPhone 6s, the Galaxy S6/S6 Edge, for example, boasts of 3GB of RAM to Apple\u2019s 1GB RAM, the front cam contains a 5MP lens and 16 in the rear, which double the camera specs of the new IPhone; and the display, Edge features 3.6M pixels to Apple\u2019s 1M pixel display. So if we are talking hardware to performance ratio, the Galaxy S6 Edge has a major advantage over Apple\u2019s latest flagship. In comparison with its counterpart, the Galaxy S6, the Edge wins in a beauty contest and is deadlocked for specs and performance. This phone is blazing fast and ultra-slim and is highly recommended.",

            "body": "If you know what you're getting into buying this phone, then you probably won't be dissapointed. Let me start out by saying, I have owned the M9, Note 3, iPhone 6, etc. The Note 3 being the most recent phone I've been using. So my comparisons start with the competitively similar models. I've got the plus model, but it's close enough. I'll try to make this short and sweet. The Good: -Great screen (although VERY oversaturated) -Decent volume -Excellent charge time (sub 30 min. for a full charge) -Solid build quality (more on the edge issues though) The Okay: -Camera is decent, image quality fair, highly compressed but typical of smart phones -Processing speed, it's typical, the average user won't need the umph these phones have anyway The Bad: -The curved screen can be very frustrating to deal with, easy to touch button you didn't mean to, etc. -EXTREMELY limited case market. I know some don't use cases, but for the other 90%, case selection is abysmal. -Touch screen sensitivity, is simply OKAY. That's with no screen protector, etc. Often missing taps and touches when gaming -BATTERY LIFE This part gets its own area. The battery, is just not good. Coming from a Note 3, you will miss having a reasonable charge throughout a full day of moderate to heavy use. This thing CHUGS through battery life. Yes it charges quickly, but I find myself to 75% by lunch having only checked my emails and maybe briefly listening to music. I have app killer on as well. I tried without app killer, and it was worse. This alone made me almost return the phone. Conclusion: If you want a good phone, with decent specs, decent screen, and can work around the issues mentioned above go for it. Be warned though, I'm not kidding about the case selection. I ended up with a LOVE MEI case, as most others either didn't do enough, or got in the way of the curved screen (which is the ONLY reason to buy this over the Note 5.",

Even when the WiFi is connected it only loads things when it feels like it (this isn't just tested on my network!) The default keyboard is crap, the software makes other apps crash frequently and there are some extremely frustrating steps backwards from the S4. One example is that you can't cancel downloades! You have to go all the way into your settings>app manager>all>your browser>force stop!!! This is so dumb!!! Also, on the s4 you could hold down on a notification and get to the app settings page right from there. Useful feature right? Well Samsung junked it and now it takes you to a page where you can make the notifications high priority or make them not show up (even though they will still run, such as a download). When this phone works its great, but good luck finding those rare gems.",

            "body": "There is no denying that this is a great looking phone, but I'm only giving 2 stars because my auto-rotate function is stuck after only 3 days of use. My camera is permanently inverted (i need to hold it upside down if I want to take a picture), and the orientation does not change when turning the phone sideways (for everything: camera, games, chrome, etc.). I found many other people online who are having the exact same problem and some have even swapped phones several times. I went in to the Verizon store, and they contacted their Samsung rep. The first one said he was unaware of this issue. I showed the Verizon salesperson all the websites detailing other people having the exact same issue, and they \"said\" they contacted a 2nd Samsung rep, who said it was a Software issue and they were working on a patch. The next day I decided to call Samsung support because I didn't fully trust the Verizon folks. The operator said that Samsung was not aware of this issue and he'd escalate the problem the best that he could. I just want to know if this is a hardware or software issue, and nobody can give me an official answer. I only have 5 more days to wait for a software patch before I reach the Verizon return deadline. I'm probably going to end up returning it and move on to a different device, which is a shame because it is such a fantastic-looking phone. My advice to potential buyers, is wait a couple months until they figure this out... or just go with the non-edge version (the issue appears to only be affecting the S6 edge) Update ** 5/7/2015 ** The best answer I received from Verizon was that it is most likely a software glitch and Samsung is working on a patch (no timeframe given). They offered to replace the phone, but it would take 2 weeks because of an s6 edge shortage. Samsung Support said they were looking in to my complaint. I could send them my phone and they'd either fix it or send me a replacement in 10 days. I didn't like either option and decided to exchange it on the last day of my verizon \"return window\" for the regular S6. I've been using the non-edge version for a week and a half now and I love the phone. I won't go in to long comparison because I didn't get much time with a fully functional S6 Edge, but I will say that the regular s6 feels a lot more stable in my hand. Maybe it's just because I just needed more time to get used to the edge, but it felt \"slicker\". You can read about all the regular features in the other reviews, but there were two things that I really like about the phone (both versions) which I did not know before purchasing it. (this is my first samsung, so sorry if these are old features) 1) The home screen's got a cool \"floating icon\" effect when you tilt the phone --> not useful for anything, but very aesthetically pleasing. 2) The phone allows you to choose up to 30 photos for your lockscreen which will cycle throughout the day. This may not be a gamechanger, but I absolutely love seeing different photos of my 5 month old throughout the day",

            "title_review": "To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because ...",
            "body": "X-posted from Verizon. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the \"gimmick\" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. \"All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along...\" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote \"...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me.\" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using \"carousels\" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the \"edge\" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to \"improve\" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization. Like every other device, this one is rife with pre-installed apps. I didn't do a whole lot of poking around to see if they could all be disabled, but every useless bit of bloatware I wanted gone -- NFL Mobile, all verizon apps except MyVerizon, Milk, Slacker, Facebook, etc. -- was easily disabled. NFC is better implemented than in the S5 resulting in less shifting about to find a \"sweet spot\" so I can more easily use Google Wallet. No problems with BT as there were in the S5, specifically a problem I had with using BT devices such as my fitbit that caused WiFi to go on the fritz while BT was active. IR transmitter is superb & the included Peel Smart Remote app took less than a minutes to configure for both my television & DirecTV box & I haven't needed to reach for a remote since. I'm not a camera junkie & I seldom take pictures of anything other than my dog being an idiot, but I have to admit that the pictures look pretty amazing. Given my limited experience, the editing tools where pretty intuitive but tbh, I only cropped a few Pics. Aside from the screen & performance & wireless charging another real improvement is in the audio when compared to my previous devices. Mind you, just as I'm not a camera junkie, I'm also not an audiophile. Like my previous handsets this has a single speaker, but unlike those it is set in the bottom edge of the phone rather than the back. I used to have to turn the volume to max & cup my hand around the back of my S5 to get decent audio but whether the S6's speaker is so significantly improved or its placement is better or a combination of the two, this thing is LOUD! I usually turn on an audio book to fall asleep to & actually had to turn this down to 50% because it was disturbing my sleep. I do occasionally cover the speaker when holding the device in landscape mode, but that's just because I haven't become fully acclimated to the device. Finally, the form-factor -- that I adore -- will require quite the adjustment from what we've all learned to be standard. It's really an excellent lesson in how uninnovative handset manufacturers have been in re-imagining both the means of delivering content & our interaction with that content -- the screen. When I reach into my pocket I want to grab the rounded bit so I can look at the flat side, because that's the screen, right? The Edge changes that paradigm, perhaps not drastically, but it changes it nonetheless. In my pre-purchase review reading some evaluators considered this an \"ergonomic problem\", some felt that their fingers hit the edge; I've found neither to be a problem. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad & with consistent use I've found my fingers fit quite comfortably on the aluminum surround without messing with the screen. Form-wise, it is instantly recognizable as a S-Series phone, but this iteration is a superb high-end rendering of that aesthetic. Although I run the risk of overstating how visually appealing this device is, I am willing to label it an objet d'art. One that I was almost afraid to use due to its apparent fragility until a few accidental drops on tile confirmed that it is as durable as it is beautiful as it is functional. Thoroughly, thoroughly pleased.",

Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed Premium). I was a little sceptical at first about buying a used phone but the new ones were a bit too expensive for me. So I decided to take the chance especially seeing the \"Premium\" added to the description. Turned out to be a good choice. I received the phone and did a restore from my backup which went seamlessly and painlessly...and also extremely fast. In no time at all I was back up and running with everything intact. To begin with there were no scratches on the phone...condition perfect. And when I checked battery health I got a reading of 100%. So as said it was like buying a brand new phone. No regrets whatsoever.",

The phone came in excellent condition, maybe one tiny mark on back but I studied it pretty hard after reading past reviews. I most likely would not have noticed. Very easy to set up since I had an iPhone before. Just transfered all info over. The charge lasts me all day! At the end of the day I still have a charge left. Haven't really taken any piTunes yet so can't say how good they will be. I love this phone!",

            "body": "Initially, I was impressed. This phone came out of the box looking new, I could not detect a scratch. It was very well packaged and worked well for about 2 weeks. Then my son started telling me about the phone freezing and shutting down and apps not working, et. I was so disappointed since I suggested purchasing the phone on Amazon. Now he is traveling out of the US and stuck with a horrible phone. I contacted Amazon to see if they could assist with a return - however, this is complicated by the fact that my son is traveling. After 40 minutes on the phone trying to find a solution, it boiled down to shipping. So I suggested sending it Amazon.UK. That was a no go from Amazon. I can understand that I guess. However, my son is still stuck with a nonfunctional phone that costs $500 and he will have to send it to me and then I will have to send it Amazon. What a mess! I have never seen an I-phone go down so quickly. I ordered premium service so at least I can return it eventually (although I'm still getting the shaft on S&H). Too bad, the phone truly was impressively packed and as advertised looked new with brand new accessories. Maybe I just got a lemon. In any case the phone did not function or work like new. If you are considering buying this phone, give this a try if you are going to able to give a good test run and be in the US to get support. I gave one as a gift to a recent Grad going abroad and it did not work out well.",

Initial inspection yielded a slight nick on the side of the case but nothing major and covered by any aftermarket case protector. I think the phone I received was better than average though and don\u2019t think it reflects what is normal. No scratches to screen or camera lenses. All function perfect. Can\u2019t detect any issues with speaker or microphones. Accurately measures my elevation changes (hiker). Bluetooth, WiFi, wireless and corded charging/data work fine. GPS and compass work well. I received it and was surprised to see 100% battery health. Have had it over a month and hasn\u2019t changed which is impressive. Suspecting that may have been changed so question how good the waterproof sealing may be, although it would have been an apple performed repair so maybe no reason to worry? I\u2019m a little concerned reading about issues people have with the returns but overall it\u2019s been a good product for me with no issues.",

The only other phone I had that compares was a Blackberry, which I miss. Since I have S7 Edge accessories, it makes sense to stick to this phone. The one I received in the latest order was actually in better condition than the description indicated.",

I called Google Fi support and they told me this is a Verizon phone (unlocked) but that the eSIM functionality of the device is factory disabled and cannot be re-enabled. I believe Google is working toward allowing dual-SIM, relying on a physical and eSIM in combination. I'd like to be able to use that if it comes out, which is not possible on this phone. And I'd like to take advantage of the eSIM benefits while traveling internationally. I'm giving 2 stars because it does actually WORK, but did not come as described.",

It seems like every time I try to turn my phone on via fingerprint, it takes at least three tries before it actually unlocks. Sometimes it doesn't work at all and I get the \"Too many unsuccessful attempts, please try again later.\" Then I have to retype my password for all the apps that allow fingerprint login which is super annoying.

            "body": "I received a mint phone that appeared to be new. It had a Google charger and cable, a headphone dongle , a usb adapter, and a sim tool. There were no signs of wear or use. The phone is unlocked and the Verizon version. Verizon stupidly disabled the eSim, so that is the only feature missing compared to the Google version for most people. The bootloader is also locked on Verizon phones, but unless you are a developer it would be fairly senseless to flash your own rom on these if you even knew how. Back to the disabled eSim - its not really a big deal except for one thing - I keep a Google Fi eSim in my phone for travel, so in essence the Google Pixel 3 lines is dual sim sort of, so when Verizon disabled the eSim they killed the dual sim feature. This phone was for my wife who doesn't need the eSim. So the bottom line is - if you don't need the eSim, and you won't unless you want two sims at once, its a beautiful phone at the lowest price online I have seen. Very happy!",

However, personally, with the incredibly high prices of smartphones from companies like Samsung, Google, and don't get me started with Apple. There are other companies out there that produce amazing hardware and software spec phones for low prices. But I stumbled upon Amazon and saw the low price for the refurbish pixels. And I got to say. This phone is amazing! I have read through a couple of other reviews on these phones on how some, unfortunately, didn't get the chance to have a good experience. Due to problems with the phone itself. I don't have a problem with the phone itself and so far I didn't have any problems with the phone, but if you ever do buy a pixel and you start having problems. Be sure to return the product and ask for another one. Everything about the phone from the camera, hardware, up to the user experience its great! I am actually very happy to have this phone. Especially the screen call feature. I LOVE that feature, now I don't have to pick up a random phone number to figure out who it is.",

Some soft keys, e.g. back, input method switch doesn't work well. I need to hit multiple times. 2. Sometimes Google Assistant was automatically launched. Was it spy on me? 3. At the beginning, when the battery reaches 1%, I still can use it for 2 hours. But after 2 months, the phone auto turn off when battery is 2%. 4. Why the camera keep \"motion on\" by default? Does it use extra memory? Personally I dislike that feature. It took me a long time to figure out how to turn that feature off. Good points: 1. I love the theme change at 10pm and 11:30.

Cons: Didn't come with headphones..does come with a dongle. You will need to buy an additional dongle if you want to charge and listen to music at the same time...

Got my sim from Best Buy, popped it in, switched active line over and boom. All the functions of the phone seem to be in top notch shape. (Knock on wood). But yeah, in my case this turned out aweosme. There was some dirt smudged on the back but with a wet paper towel it came right off. I'm honestly shocked at the immaculate conditions of this renewed phone. Highly recommend in my case.",

            "body": "Truly the BEST phone I have ever used! This is coming from a person who was burned...(TWICE)... by Google and the Pixel 1's faulty microphone. However I'm a forgiving kind of guy and man am I glad I got over my first experience with Pixel devices and ordered this one! Ok, so what's so good about this phone, huh? EVERYTHING! The phone is super fast and snappy with any APP I use. I'm a heavy gamer and this phone has been able to easily play any games IV thrown at it. Plus they look amazing with the screen in this phone. The OLED screen is such a treat for my eyes. Deep, rich, and vibrant...I love watching movies with it! And I know you've all heard about the \"hideously huge notch\" and how it just ruins everything..... Well, I barely notice it. In fact there are some neat apps that can do some really cool things with the notch like putting a color changing strip around it that will work as notification alert or battery bar. And that leads perfectly to the next great thing, the battery. I am a very heavy user and the battery will last me almost the entire day. The speed charger is blazingly fast so if I should have to plug it in before the days up, it only takes about 10-15 mins to get 25-30%. Then there's the fact that Pixel users get all the updates first. I love rubbing that in Samsung users faces! Let's see....what am I forgetting..... Ahhh yes, saved the best for last. The camera. There aren't words to describe how damn good the camera really is. I still can't believe a cellphone can take pictures like this. Blows my mind. It has actually inspired me to take up photography as a hobby. Not to mention Google will backup and store an UNLIMITED amount of photos and videos for FREE! Yeah, yeah, I know I sound like Googles little fanboy. Hell I admit I am. No shame here! Just go ahead and get this phone and I promise you'll be a fanboy/fangirl too! Theres alot of other great features to this phone that I haven't mentioned so I guess you'll just have to get one and see for yourselves. Trust me you won't regret it! Oh yea, I did buy mine refurbished and it looked like new. Not a scratch on it. the only difference was it came without the original charger. But it refurbed and save yourself few bucks. Now go get PIXELING!",

This phone has absolutely great and if I told anyone I bought it new the minute after I removed it from the package they would believed me.

My product, unlike other reviews, came with all Google licensed accessories, excluding the pixel buds, and an adapter. Product appears new, no scratches, no previous use or wear associated with it. Great phone as well. No complaints so far. I've turned off most of the extras as it drains the battery a lot. Great adaptive battery life, some days with 2 full days of use, and some just a day if I'm using it for a lot. I did buy headphone adapters as I still have some auxiliary cable products.

            "body": "I bought this phone one year ago, coming from a Pixel 1. Not to make the review long because there are plenty reviews on YouTube: PROS 1. That camera. Easy to use, great detail, amazing dynamic range, very nice portrait effect and fast. I encountered no issues with it like some other people said. Maybe Google updated the cam app. Moreover, the wide angle selfie camera is a plus. 2. Smartness. This phone is packed with AI features. For example: it records all songs it heard, even if I didn't ask for it. 3. Squeeze for Google Assistant. If you like GA, this is a very quick and handy feature. 4. Front facing speakers. Compared with Pixel 1, the front facing speakers are a beauty. Strong and sound very well. 5. Beautiful screen. This is sharp and colorful. CONS: 1. Relatively slow processor. Don't get me wrong, I like how fast it is, and for my daily basis this is OK. But some heavy apps may result a bit slow for some people, especially comparing the phone to other newer ones like OnePlus 7 Pro. 2. Low RAM. 4 gb is not enough sometimes. For example, opening several apps at the same time and then switching between them is slow. 6 gb would have been much much better. 3. Back easily scratched. But can be solved easily with any case. 4. Screen not very bright. Noticeable while being outside. 5. Notch. I'm already used to it, but it can bother some picky people. Overall, I can say I bought the phone for the camera. I don't really care about anything else. If the processor can handle texting, web browsing, playing music smoothly I'm happy. And it does.",

            "body": "My wife cracked her screen and put in a Verizon insurance claim to get it repaired. However, uBreakiFix said they couldn't repair it because there was an internal PART MISSING. This was clearly a MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I reached out to Verizon and escalated the issue, but they declined to help and sent me to Google tech support. Google also declined saying that I'd need to get the screen fixed before they could help, which left me in a catch-22. So, bottom line, I was sold A DEFECTIVE PHONE and was forced to pay a replacement phone deductible ($199) to get it replaced. I suspect the uBreakiFix contract may have been specifically setup to ensnare customers into paying the full deductible when the screen breaks, while Google manufacturing cut corners on their phones, all so they can't be fixed. I wonder how many more Pixel 3XL phones have this defect and people are stuck paying the high deductible. THIS IS A CHEAT! Shame on Google and Verizon! I will never again buy another Google phone and am seriously considering dumping Verizon after 20+ years of loyalty. So much for the manufacturer's warranty. It's a joke.",

But I haven't fully activated it because it did not come with the USB-USB C adapter for you to transfer everything over from your old phone. In fact this package did not come with any of the certified Google peripherals. The SAMSUNG charger it came with doesn't even work for the Pixel 3XL. No adapter for carrying over my information, no headphones so I can't listen to sound since this phone requires the new USB C headphones, and finally I can't even use the phone because there is no way to charge it once it's battery runs out. Overall I like that they actually sent me, from what I can see far, decently refurbished product. BUT the fact that I can't use it for anything because all the little external things that a phone requires for use were not included.",

            "body": "I've owned four iterations of the iPhone and another five Androids, including the Moto Droid Maxx, the Galaxy SIII and S5, and the Note 2 before the most recent Galaxy S7, so I have a solid base of experience in this field. Pros: Excellent battery life, strong and durable, blazing fast, gorgeous large screen/, amazing camera, utilization of the USB-C reversible charge cable. I love this phone and have been nothing short of impressed with it through two months of use. The battery can last 14 hours with moderate to heavy use. I am a photography nut and the camera blows me away consistently. I'm also something of a stickler on the display and the screen is incredible. Cons: No headphone port, which is only a con if you use headphones. No back/menu buttons. I've been using the S7 for close to three years and have always had the back button on my androids. This one eliminates that feature and through two months of use, I still haven't got used to it not being there. The phone isn't truly unlocked. I haven't figured out how to use tethering with this phone on my StraightTalk plan even though I could do it on my old S7. I keep getting \"you aren't subscribed to this service\" and no apps seem to have the workaround. Conclusion: Great phone, especially for this price point. Refurbished condition is only evident in the fact they ship it in a plain cardboard box instead of a fancy Google box.",

            "body": "This review is more about my experience of buying a renewed phone, rather than the phone itself. I purchased this phone to replace my pixel, and the *only* reason I was replacing that was because of the rapid battery drain. I didn't want to spend the money on a new pixel 4 because I'm not impressed with the battery reviews on it. My choices were to replace my pixel battery ($100) or buy a renewed phone for a couple of hundred more than I would have spent to replace the pixel battery. I started watching these renewed pixel 3xls to see how the pricing was going. I didn't want to spend more than $400, so I kept waiting and waiting. Then a 128gb one came up for $367, which I thought was a really good price. I ordered it on a Tuesday, it said it would be here the following Monday, but it arrived during the day on Friday. Yeah! The packaging was really good, the phone was secure. The phone was in a bag in the box, and in the box was also a charger and cable. The phone was not charged, but no biggie. It charged really fast. The one thing I noticed after inspection, was two scratches in the top third of the phone. I was so bummed! Now I knew why the phone was so much less. However, you can only see the scratches at a certain angle and when the screen is off. I can't feel them when running my finger over. So, another decision: can I live with the scratch that is only visible under certain angles, and angles that I would be unlikely to ever hold my phone at and when the screen is off, or do I send it back? I decided to charge it up, install my stuff and see how it goes. Well, the scratches aren't a big deal at all. There is no interference with my phone interaction/useability. It's a trade off, but I think a worthwhile trade off - this is the only physical flaw on the phone. I plan to keep this one until around pixel 6 or so, so again, I think it's worth it. I'm very happy I got a really good deal, and other than the scratches, I feel like the phone is brand new.",

            "body": "I recently purchased this renewed Pixel 3 XL to replace my (very) aging Samsung Note 3. I'm not going to rave about the performance increase for obvious reasons. I will say that I find the usability (UI) of the Pixel 3 vs the Note 3 to be so delightful. It's simple, fluid, and intuitive. It's really nice to no longer have TouchWiz encapsulating the basic Android UI experience. I didn't realize just how intrusive TouchWiz was until it wasn't there. My Pixel 3 XL came in a white box with an Amazon Basics charger and charge cable. The cable works fine. I have not tested the charger since I use a charge station. The phone itself looks absolutely perfect. No scuffs, scratches, not even a fleck of dust on it. I was able to transfer my contacts via online back up without issue. The camera is amazing, which I realize goes without saying. A quick comment on battery life, I only lost 2% overnight with both wifi and 4G turned ON. My Note 3 will lose almost 20%-30% under similar conditions (even with the new battery that I have for it). Overall, my first impressions are very, very positive. Hopefully time will be as kind to my Pixel 3 XL as it was to my Note 3.",

Under $400 is the price that Google should have been selling this phone for originally. The Pixel 3 XL is a much better unit than the previous Pixel 2 XL I had owned last. It feels more solid and is faster. It would be even better if Google hadn't copied Apple's silly notch at the top. How about some originality Google? My only complaint is that Amazon only gives a 90 day warranty with their renewed products. Why so short? If the unit WAS actually renewed back up to original specs, then it should be offered with the full manufacturer warranty. Does Amazon not have any confidence in their work?",

I do admit that the camera on Pixel 3 is better than iPhone in most lighting situations but the lack of customer service is not worth the gamble for such an expensive phone. The software crashed after a few days of usage and the retailer refused to take responsibility for exchange or refund or repair. Google has no support in any of the 20 countries I have traveled to since purchasing the phone and their website offers no convenient solutions without shipping the phone to a service center in Singapore or US. I am not sure how Google thinks this is an efficient way to deal with software issues, but I am not the customer who can afford to be without my main phone for 6 weeks. The two year warranty they offer is as good as no warranty in my opinion and Google should not be charging these prices if they have not figured out their license problems internationally. Stay away from Google phones and make sure to spread the word so no one else experiences what I have experienced.",

            "body": "Great phone overall; however, there are two minor annoyances. There is no separate headphone jack -- everything uses the USB-C port. This means that you cannot charge the phone's battery and use headphones at the same time, since they both require the single USB port. The supplied ear buds have a USB-C connector. There is a USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone adapter, so you can use regular headphones. For what it's worth, the supplied ear buds use a slightly stiffer loop in the cable that fits inside the earlobe, which I find much more comfortable and better-retained than traditional ear buds. The back of the phone is so slippery that it will not sit in place on even a very slight (e.g., two-degree) slope without sliding off -- e.g., an open notebook in front of my computer screen. This makes a protective cover mandatory for me, which is not a problem since I have a cover.",

The phone is completely worth it the only thing I'm not completely in love with is the camera, is not bad it takes pretty good pictures but previously owned a zte axon 7 and the quality is lower on the Huawei Y9 which we don't mind honestly since this Huawei is not as expensive as the axon it is expected. But for the price is definitely a must buy we were weary of buying it because we saw a couple reviews and answers saying it might only take 2g or 3g but it received a 4g signal and everything works smoothly, we are currently using Cricket Wireless as our service provider. We had only purchased one phone to check if we like it and if it worked with Cricket and now we're ready to make another purchase because we loved it.",

Also cames with Android Oreo out of the box. The Huawei cloud services that they offer isn't available in the US, but no big deal when Google keeps everything on their cloud. I did use the help app to ask some questions about settings and got answers back within in a few hours from Huawei's help team. Overall, a great phone at a great price. BUY IT!",

The camera is not the worst but wish it was better in low light. Of course it's a budget phone but well worth money paid. Face ID sensor works great. The only downside is no nfc which means no Google pay as it is in a low of Huawei phones.... Due to security reasons which could be bogus. But overall an awesome piece of equipment. fits 2 SIM cards and excpandable storage! Huge bright and crisp display. I really like this phone!! \ud83d\ude4c",

Money was wasted on screen protectors, cover, and even a non reimbursable phone transfer fee from my carrier since I didn't know it was locked until they did their thing. Very upset at the financial loss due to mis-advertising considering the times we live in have been harsh on me.",

This is not a minor flaw; it makes the phone completely useless to me. It is also something extremely easy to check beforehand so \u00bfWhy is the seller so careless? Also, could not get a replacement because the seller (GM Deals) did not want to apply the Amazon Renewed Guarantee terms under which the item was sold (this is a scam). This seller benefits from the increase of sales from the Amazon Renewed Guarantee tag, but does not accept the responsibility and terms it comes with. I would avoid buying if it comes from GM Deals. Amazon should enforce the Amazon Renewed Guarantee terms when giving this tag to third-party sellers. Edit: After almost a month I got a full refund. I will slightly increase rating solely on the customer support given by Giancarlo G. which was great, very helpful and polite. But the seller did not want to cooperate.",

No glitching, long battery life that lasts all day as long as I'm not watching a bunch of videos, it takes great pictures day and night.

L'ho spedito all'assistenza Xiaomi, la quale mi presenta un preventivo di riparazione di quasi 180 \u20ac per ossidazione. Non avendo fatto cadere il telefono in acqua chiedo spiegazioni, mi rispondono che probabilmente il problema \u00e8 dovuto all'umidit\u00e0 di cucina o bagno. Che dire? Non portate il telefono in bagno se avete intenzione di fare una doccia o in cucina se pensate di cucinare. Dimenticavo, la ditta mi ha proposto un coupon di ben \u20ac 30, da utilizzare sul loro sito. Secondo voi l'ho utilizzato?",

Didn't talk to anyone about it yet, if it gets to be a big problem I'll call customer service, either at vendor or Verizon, manufacturer",

It's like everything about the device was mistreated, so they slapped a new screen on the device and promised renewed and sold for more than eBay was seeking them for.

            "body": "I have had this phone for over three months. Here is my opinion. This is the best phoe I have had. I have not regretted the decision to buy this phone for a second. I have been a fan of the larger phones for years. I have gone throught the Note 7-10 phones and felt the large screen and form was perfect. I have always like using the S pen for editing as finger touch on a phone screen is not always perfect. I was worried that I might miss the S pen factor and the benefits of the Note series phones from Samsung. Plus, a folding phone was a new form and the earlier Samsung fold has some hinge issues. First, the fold factor is flawless. There is a clear and distinct opening and closing hinge. There is no doubt when the screen is fully closed or opened. And, the hinge is sturdy. No concerns about over stressing the joint. When closed, the front screen is more than adequate for answering or taking a quick look at messages/emails. It also is great for a quick look at a news feed. The folded size is a benefit in putting it in a narrow cell phone pocket or pants pocket. I find the folded ocnfiguraiton much easier to handle when carrying the phone or making a call. After looking at the front screen, opening the phone gives a near tablet size experience. The phone will allow you to read an app on the smaller front screen, and when opened, show the same information in a full expanded view. It does allow rotation and the screen fills with whatever is being viewed. Movies like Netflix allow a wide screen format or a fully expanded view. When sending messages, folding the phone to 90 degrees allows a large keyboard on the bottom hald and the messages or email on the top half. That's great for reviewing and sending information. Regarding the screens... The front screen has a protector that is different than the inside screen. I did remove the protector as it is exposed to daily use and does show some wear. There are multiple screen protectors on the market. It is an easy replacement. The inner screen has a softer and more rubbery feel. It doesn't bother me. I do need to clean it or wipe it off when it looks smudged. I have not had to replace it and it has stood up to three months of daily use. Being hidden inside the phone except when used keeps it from excessive wear. I do note that many people have replaced the inner protector without issues. Charging the battery gives me more than enough for daily moderate use. I have never had less than 20% at the end of the day. And, I keep my screen bright. I do not have background apps running all the time. My only gripe is that the phone are the case protectores. The phone when folded is thick. It is not so thick as to be a problem in a pocket or coat. However, all of the cases are thick and add more bulk than I want. My current solution is to only use a back case protector. The front and sides are uncovered. This has resulted in a small cosmetic ding on the hinge. But, even with an occaional drop, the found has worked without a problem. I can enthusiastically say that if you are considering this phone, you will not regret the purchase. The new form is fantastic. When folded, easy to answer and scan information. When opened, a tablet like experience. The best Samsung ever.",

            "title_review": "Expensive and Woefully Inferior to an Apple/iOS Device",
            "body": "In a nutshell, if you are am iOS user and you have serious tasks to accomplish, never transition to a device running Android operating system. It's Android and not iOS. iOS still has the best ecosystem of all Operating Systems: PC, tablet, or phone. Luckily for me I can still still fall back to my iPhone 12 Pro Max. Yes, I have these 2 top of the line phones, courtesy of my job. I don't have to suffer using a Samsung phone. The Galaxy ZFold 2 5G at that. Samsung made a great phone with some inferior hardware in it: First: The fingerprint sensor just makes too many misreads. This is clearly inferior to Apple's Touch ID. The obnoxious iPhone 6S Touch ID was even better than the Galaxy ZFold2's fingerprint sensor. Second: NFC reader in this $2,000 Galaxy ZFold 2 is unbelievably unreliable. I could hold up a queue at the store trying to make this junk work. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. This issue is something I have never ever encountered in iPhone XS Max, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and my current iPhone 12 Pro Max. Third: Face recognition in the Galaxy Z Fold2 is nowhere close to an iPhone's face recognition. The Galaxy Z Fold2's facial recognition is slow and not nearly as reliable in recognizing faces. Fourth: Unlike an Apple device that pays attention to network quality, this phone will preferentially connect to 5G over 4G, regardless if 5G is not reliable. I'm not talking about Verizon's 5G UWB, which is technically the only real 5G in existence in few spotty places in a some cities. I'm talking about just Verizon's so called 'Nationwide 5G', which is 4G LTE made faster with more capacity to handle data traffic, but nowhere close to the real 5G. Unfortunately pseudo-5G from any carrier is not yet consistently reliable at this time. Sometimes 4G LTE will provides better user experience over unreliable pseudo-5G. So this Galaxy Z Fold2 preferentially connects to pseudo-5G when available even if signal is weak, but keeps buffering when streaming HD music. While an iPhone 12 Pro Max next to it preferentially connects to the network with the best conditions, is connected to 4G LTE instead of pseudo-5G, but streaming the same HD music flawlessly. Many other countless deficits of the Galaxy Z Fold2 5G is software side. It is an amazing piece of equipment, but largely limited by the software it runs and running its hardware. For a $2,000 phone, it's reduced to nothing more than a less expensive phone with a smaller screen. You go for it, if a large screen is for you. I loved the large screen, but it was quickly extinguished by the fact that Android versions of the same iOS apps will never work as flawlessly as their iOS counterparts. This is a huge lesson that hit me like being run over by a tank. I have never used Android since several versions ago. I first used an Android phone when Samsung released the Galaxy Note 2. That was nearly a decade or so ago. Android came a long way since then. It still remains woefully inferior to Apple's iOS. Android remains years behind iOS. The Bluetooth connectivity in an Android device remains painfully unreliable compared to an iOS device. I depend on certain apps to do my job and essentially get things done so I earn a living. The Android versions of the apps I use in business just simply don't work. Maybe because of the screens of the Galaxy Z Fold2, one being skinny while the other being twice the size, I could not be authenticated because the lower portion of the on-screen keyboard is cut off and won't re-size to fit either screen. Or the apps won't log-in 95% of the time, works decently 5% of the time. Some of my colleagues are switching to iPhones because the iPhone versions of the apps we use work flawlessly all the time. I played with the Disney+ app in this phone. It was a disaster. I downloaded 20Gb worth of movies into the device before my flight supposedly for offline watching. I started watching my downloaded movies while the plane was still on the ground. As the plane ascended and I lost internet connection, obviously. The app quit playing my downloaded movies because I'm no longer connected to the internet. The app literally signed me out and wants me to log back in, 30,000 ft up in the air. I scrambled to connect to the plane's Wi-Fi, logged in and carried on. While I had to switch from the Disney+ app to a browser to connect to plane's Wi-Fi, my Bose earbud lost connection to the phone. I had to reboot the Galaxy Z Fold2 to make everything work again. Sounds complicated and cumbersome, but yes I had to go trough all that crap to make it work. I thought that was a fluke and a one-off occurrence. On my flight back home, the same thing happened, except this time around some of my downloaded movies for \"offline\" watching won't play at all. This is just something I have never experienced in an Apple device with a similar setup, performing a similar task. Not ever! Even the native visual voicemail app in this Galaxy Z Fold2 5G does not work with Verizon or AT&T, either standard (free) visual voicemail or paid premium visual voicemail service. The carrier's respective high level tech support people cannot make it work. And so can't Samsung's tech support either. However, a third party provider, YouMail will work. Still not as good as an iPhone's standard visual voicemail. I am used to the flawlessness and reliability of the iPhone and its apps that I am retiring this Galaxy Z Fold2 5G just after 2 months of use. I can't even use it as a home office phone for the lack of working visual voicemail. I will never know if someone left me a voicemail. No indicator icon whatsoever.i have to manually call the voicemail number. I can't use it to control home automation systems either: the Android Savant app does not work as good as the Savant iOS version. It keeps disconnecting from he host and the reconnecting part is 90% done manually. Well, for perspective, Apple runs the guts of Savant Pro systems. So obviously it is naturally optimized for Apple. For the good side of this phone: it's an engineering marvel on its own right. The camera, while not as good as other Samsung models, is still quite decent. Unless you are someone who derives great satisfaction in awesome photos or who makes a living out of its cameras, then grab another model. The cameras in a Samsung phone is one thing that I will give a two-thumbs-up over an iPhone's of any generation. I'm still not that pleased with my iPhone 12 Pro Max's camera. Overall, this Galaxy Z Fold2 is not for me. It's expensive for the limited functions and a degraded user experience it provides. It's got tons of potential that are mostly extinguished by the fact that is running a less-than-perfect Operating System and suite of software to complement it. Just like any hardware, if the software running it is crappy, you could have the best hardware in the world in your hands, but has lackluster performance. This is exactly the Galaxy Z Fold2 to me. If you do serious tasks, particularly for business, this is not the right tool. Taking photos, viewing them, reading eBooks, making basic calls, texting, browsing the web - this thing can do well - assuming you don't rely on Samsung Pass to assist you with your logins. If you do, you're better off using something else. Samsung Pass is quite dumb, redundant, and cannot remember certain sites. Again the iPhone's Passwords is still way more reliable than Samsung Pass.",

            "body": "I wanted to love this thing, but quite frankly it's not worth the hefty price. I switched to samsung from iphone some 10 years ago because I loved the phablet experience from the early Notes (Note3 as a matter of fact). I actually don't like the new notes compared to the old ones. The feel in your hand and the size with a stylus were amazing. I digress.... this is about the Z fold 2. I just couldn't pass up the pull to buy the latest gadget. Unfortunately, it's just not \"there\" yet. I think it needs to be double the size of the note20 when you open it. So in my mind it is still not big enough. The front screen is still too small to really use..... the inside screen is just simply Meh.....and the abilty to effectively use the wider screen really isn't \"there yet\" (programs/apps lagging). When I say the inside screen is Meh, I mean that it has a horrible \"feel\" to it and even with me being excessively protective and careful with it, it already has a small ding in it. From what I have no idea as i baby this thing. And I am not a young kid that abuses their devices (I'm 50 and take excellent care of this thing). I am going on 6 months of owning this phone and I still do not think the price is justified. I won't be a sucker an buy the next iteration that comes out. Not for this price.",

No answering emails near a pool or in the bath. I missed that. -Camera is bad. Slow shutter, subpar quality, could not capture motion well (kids). -Bad radios. Had dropped calls for the first time in YEARS. Unreal. Internet connection was worse. Bluetooth was cutting in and out. Really surprised. -Plastic cheap looking back. Nah. -Stuttered when pushed. I guess I'm spoiled by top tier processors and RAM amounts. -No dual speakers. Makes a huge difference in sound. -No wireless charging. I miss that. -No reverse wireless charging. I miss that too. -Less RAM so apps reload sooner. I appreciated the fact that it had expandable storage. Honestly, it does everything fine for the average consumer. But not for someone used to flagship phones. The camera is too important to me, among other details it whiffs on.",

            "body": "I don't write many reviews, but since this phone is new to the US market, I thought I would throw my two cents in. I have only had two smartphones since 2016, yep I was a big hold out, and they were both cheap BLU phones, so I don't have much to compare this to. It's more phone than I need, and it's a great phone so far, except for one thing. It has no LED notification light. I didn't know this when I bought it, and I'm struggling. The reason I decided to replace my year and a half old phone is that the notification light constantly flashed for no known reason. I always have sound off, and I'm not always right near my phone, so it's annoying thinking I missed a call or text and checking my phone, I realize it's just a glitch. This phone doesn't tell me I missed a call or message unless I check it. I think that's better, but only slightly. Some people will not be bothered by this, but I only realized this after I bought it, even after reading many reviews. The fingerprint sensor is ok, fails sometimes, and I have no screen protector, but it might fail more often with one. You can use the PIN option as well. It takes pretty good pictures, but again, I can only compare with not so great phones. I thought I would be wowed by this phone after reading all the reviews and coming from a true budget phone, but I'm just on the fence. So essentially my two cents is do a lot of research and make sure this, or any phone, has the features you want, because while this phone is new to the US market and is getting rave reviews, there might be a better phone out there even cheaper.",

            "body": "I wanted to buy an unlocked, reasonably priced, sort of future proof phone because I'm not totally satisfied with my current carrier (Boost Mobile) and I am tired of \"collecting\" carrier-locked phones in a drawer when I switch to a new provider and have to purchase a new device. I was almost set on purchasing a Galaxy A51 when the A71 5G showed up on Amazon. It looked like a huge step up from my old phone (Galaxy A20) as well as the A51. I wasn't necessarily looking for 5G because it's still in its infancy, but things like the Snapdragon 765G processor, 128GB of storage and 6GB RAM were appealing, not to mention the 6.7-inch full HD+ Super AMOLED display. After briefly being distracted by the Galaxy S10 Lite (same price, faster processor, but no headphone jack), I popped for the A71 5G. So far, I'm not sure I made the right choice; here's why: 1.) My old A20 had a 4000 mAh battery that frankly was disappointing. It came up short when compared to my previous phone, an LG XCharge that was nothing special except for the 4500 mAh battery that had unreal longevity (in fact, I recently turned it on after it has sat in a drawer for almost four months and it had 65% charge left). Most days, I had to charge the A20 every night. I bring this up because just yesterday I had to recharge my new A71 5G TWICE in one day. 2.) There are a few barriers in the smallish house where I live that challenge the wifi router. The A20 would disconnect sometimes; the A71 5G disconnects much more frequently. Some apps seem more susceptible to disconnection than others, which made me wonder if the issue was the apps rather than the connection. With the A20, I'm pretty sure the apps were the problem; I'm not so sure with the A71 5G. I have seen other reviews here and elsewhere that reference disconnection issues with this phone. Hmm... 3.) The step up to full HD from the A20's 720p was a bigger improvement than I expected, so this is a plus for the new phone. However, the audio is just a lateral move; neither is that great. While this isn't a deal breaker per se, the new LG Velvet as well as the new Galaxy S20 Fe both have stereo speakers; while the S20 FE is $100 more (as I write this), the LG is the same price and has twice the storage (256GB vs 128GB). Honestly if there were an unlocked version of the LG Velvet available today, I'd take a serious look at it. Overall, the pluses of my A71 5G don't quite outweigh the minuses. With the S10 Lite still being available at the same price (albeit sans headphone jack) and the new S20 FE being just $100 more, if the connection issues can't be resolved with this A71 5G, I may be making a change.",

Never heard anything. Sadly one day we plugged it in to see if we could get it charged and it got really hot started smoking a little now it won\u2019t do anything.

FYI, this Samsung A71 5G WON'T WORK with C-Spire Wireless as they DON'T Presently Allow this UNLOCKED Smartphone on their System. However they might in the Near Future. Both T-Mobile Low and Mid Band 5G work Flawlessly and AT&T's 5G DSS (Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is Great too, However AT&T Doesn't Offer Dedicated 5G Bandwidth so Expect Slower 5G Speeds with AT&T vs T-Mobile since T-Mobile has Dedicated 5G Bandwidth.

            "body": "before this phone, I had a Motorola G6 that just worked okay until the Android pie 9 update. After that, it was slow and work like crap. So I decided to go back to Samsung and finally be able to schedule my text messages to send when I wanted them to again. This phone is quick and works well. The fingerprint sensor works okay on WiFi and hardly at all when I'm out of the house and taking data, so I switched to face recognition. It with very well and asked for a shot of me with glasses. But with a mask?? \ud83d\ude37 Probably not a good idea, so I sweetie my pattern when I'm wearing one. I do wish the newer phones wouldn't go with the very slim and long design, because the width of the phone is really the real estate that I'm looking for, but that's all the newer phones, I guess. (Small-handed people complaining about their phones being too hard to hold?) I'm very happy with this phone. Just a heads up: if you're planning to use an unlocked phone with Tracfone on Verizon, everything works great except Visual Voicemail. They still can't get that running, and I've pretty much given up on it. Any tips?",

            "body": "I had this phone for 3 weeks when it started acting up. I contacted Tracfone and over the next 2 weeks we tried to get the phone to work properly. Long story short, it will not do anything now. Won't turn off, won't call, won't accept calls. Tracfone told me over a week ago that it was sending me a new phone. Called AGAIN yesterday and they told me that a return box was on the way to me and would be here by last night. The tracking number they gave me is not recognized by any carried. No box arrived. I was told that they would have to have the phone back in their possession before they send me a new one. Of course, the return to Amazon is no longer possible. I feel that Tracfone is playing me. They have my $250 for the phone and are not interested in customer service. I have used Samsung for years and I guess I just got a lemon. In the meantime, I am out a lot of money and have nothing to show for it. BEWARE OF NO CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM TRACFONE1",

            "body": "So i got this phone because we ported from ATT to verizon prepaid. Everything on the port over side went smooth but the phone would not make or receive calls. It was very weird because verizon thought it was the sim so we replaced the sim and we tried a temp number because verizon thought it might be the port over having issues but in the end it was the phone. for some reason my post paid business account verizon sim card would work on the phone. it was very odd. i was able to send and receive calls, internet worked, texts/mms all worked on my post paid sim but on the prepaid sim it would not work. we did manage to get it to work ONCE when i switched the sim from an iphone 8 to the A50, verizon thought that the phone was an iphone 8 so it let the sim work but once the system recognized the imei of the samsung a50, it would deactivate the HD voice calling as per verizon, which will stop all voice or voLTE services. so it's a verizon(prepaid) issue not knowing what the phone is. if the phone is recognized by the system it will work. the phone is CAPABLE of being used on the cdma network (because it works when you switch the sim from an iphone make a call and then switch it back to the phone you should be able to either make or receive 1 call) but because VERIZON prepaid doesn't recognize the phone or what kind of phone it is, it does not work. so shame on your verizon(prepaid) for basically not letting a unlocked cdma phone to work on your network. anyway it's a good phone, it's not s class fast but it has almost all the features you would need. For any other major carrier, i do suggest this phone, but if you are going verizon (prepaid, only tested for about 20 mins on my post paid business account), i would say don't even try because you will run into headaches.",

            "body": "This Samsung A71 is a lousy phone. It feels pretty good in the hand but otherwise it's mostly infuriating to use. So many topics to complain about but I'll try to limit it to 3 so I can get on with my life. 1. The Bluetooth worked ok at the start but within a few months it went to suck. Constantly dropping out for several seconds of silence and then picking back up - no matter which headphones I am using or how close I am to phone. Switching BT on and off, restarting entire phone, fiddling with settings for ages all no help. Now must return. 2. Bixby personal assistant feature is intrusive and annoying AF and you can't turn it off 3. Keyboard layout and poor spell check routine makes texting painful. Tiny space key next to huge period key and little go button. WTH? Could go on but that's enough. All my other phones both those less and more expensive and both androids from other companies and apple models have been better and less annoying. It seems solid from a physical standpoint though.",

Speaking generally 5G is in its beginning for most carriers in most of the country so whatever phone you get you will be LTE most of the time for quite a while. Note: There may be errors and of course comparing any providers will have to be based on location and coverage. There may be no 5G coverage at where I live and the speeds vary widely.

I previously had an Xperia 1 II and one of my favorite things about that phone is the display, the screen, it\u2019s amazing! So good that I stopped bringing my iPad on trips to watch movies. I did travel a bit during the pandemic and being able to watch films and TV on my phone, which is always with me, at the very highest quality was very spoiling. I also am a content creator - a cinematographer and photographer - so when I heard about the Xperia PRO, that it has the same screen that hooked me on the Xperia 1 II, but also has an HDMI input and can be used as an on-camera monitor, this I needed to see so I picked one up. Most of the monitors I use on shoots are heavier, thicker, use external batteries, and frankly, the display quality usually isn\u2019t as good. So now I literally have a 5G phone that I can take out of my pocket, mount on my camera, and shoot with, referencing a display that offers HDR, 4K resolution, and even pinch to zoom. The Xperia PRO is robust and has very good battery life. Highly recommended for all but especially for content creators like videographers, cinematographers and photographers.",

Current Software Version: Android 10 Bluetooth Version/Range: 4.2 \u2013 30\u2019 Range FAQ How can I install available updates? In many cases updating your product to the latest software version will alleviate any issues experienced. To update your device please navigate to Settings > System > System update > Check for update to check if updates are available. Follow the on screen prompts to install the latest software version if available.= How can I close an app that has stopped working? Open Settings on your phone and select Apps. Then find the app you're having issues with and select Force Stop. I want to conserve battery life. How can I activate the Power Saver mode? On your phone, open Settings, then choose and activate Battery Power Saving. Please also be aware that battery life depends on a variety of factors such as device usage frequency, application requirements, your current operating system, and cellular signal strength. How can I back up my files? Navigate to Settings > System > Backup, and switch backup on. How can I reset my smartphone's network settings? Navigate to Settings > Network & Internet > more_vert > Reset. Performing this reset may help if you're having connection issues. How do I connect my phone to my carrier network? If your Nokia phone and network are compatible, place your SIM card in the SIM card tray using the included SIM card removal tool to open the SIM tray. Once your SIM card has been inserted into the device, power on your phone and proceed through the product setup steps. If you are not able to connect to your network after finalizing the product setup, please contact your carrier support for additional assistance as every carrier has different steps to assist you in ensuring your product connects to their compatible network. How can I ensure other people hear me on my microphone? If you are experiencing microphone issues with your device and your product has a Google Assistant button, please ensure that the Google Assistant button is not stuck or dirty as this will cause the microphone to not function as intended. If the Google Assistant button is not obstructed, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If the headphone port is also clear, please disable the microphone permission of the Google Assistant, by going to Settings > Apps & Notifications > Google App > Permission > Microphone > Deny. How can I turn up the volume to my speaker? First, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. If your headphone port is clear, please make sure that \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d is not enabled. To disable this setting, navigate to Settings > Do not disturb. Make sure this is toggled off. If Do Not Disturb is off, navigate to Settings > Sounds and vibration > Volume > move the Media slider to the right to increase volume and test your speaker. If you are still not able to hear any audio, check the settings of the application that you are using from the Settings menu as many applications will have their own volume settings. Why is my phone feeling warm, closing apps or occasionally slowing down? During extended operation, the device may feel warm. In most cases, this is normal. To avoid getting too warm, the device may automatically slow down, dim display during a video call, close apps, switch off charging, and if necessary, switch itself off. If the device is not working properly, take it to the nearest authorized service facility. How do I reboot my smartphone when it\u2019s not responding? If your phone is unresponsive, you can perform a \u201csoft reset\u201d by pressing the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 15 seconds (or until phone vibrates). Your phone should then restart momentarily. This is a safe and quick way to reboot your device without losing or erasing any data. My phone won\u2019t charge. What should I do? First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should. Then, try turning your phone off completely and plugging it into the socket - bear in mind if the battery is completely drained, it might take up to 2 or 3 minutes to start charging. How can I contact support? Our customer support page offers a number of ways that you can contact support. Please visit the Nokia website for further assistance. How do I fix touch sensitivity issues on my phone? Before performing any additional troubleshooting steps, please ensure that your product does not show any physical damage, has not been exposed to water, the screen is clean, and your fingers and hands are not wet or dirty. Please also remove any 3rd party screen protectors that you may have on the device as non Nokia branded screen protectors may decrease the touch sensitivity of the device. If none of these solutions resolve the issue that you are facing, please perform a hard reset back to factory settings. Please note: a hard reset will completely erase all the data, settings and content on your smartphone, returning it to the original factory settings. We strongly advise that you back up your device before a hard reset. Visit here to learn more about how to back up your smartphone remotely. To reset your smartphone and erase all its content, first make sure your phone is connected to a power source. We also recommend that your battery is at least 50% charged when you perform a hard reset. Press the volume up key and the power button simultaneously for about 30 seconds or until the root menu appears. Then choose the action you want to take from the root menu, in this case \u201cWipe data/factory reset\u201d. Alternatively, you can also perform a hard reset by tapping Settings > Backup & Reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone > Erase everything.",

Over 200 contacts, personal pictures, text messages, and call history. BOTH of these two phones had this. One of the phones is secured and I cannot remove the old contact data. I'm afraid to use use it because I don't want my backup assistant updating all those prior contacts leaving me with hours of time cleaning it up - provided the prior contacts can be cleaned off the phone.

            "body": "I got this phone shipped to Hawaii. It shipped from South Carolina, and arrived in less than 3 days! The phone was $27 with $5 dollar shipping. More than 4500 miles in that short of time. The phone itself was better than I expected it to be. Came with phone, charger, and battery. Practical, tough, and great battery life. Nice, large buttons that light up. I switched from an iPhone. I use this phone for calling and text messaging, and use the iPhone for music, apps, and internet when connected to WiFi. I save $20 a month and have a more practical phone that can last a week without being charged. I suggest buying from \"Quality Used Phones\" if you want some fast shipping. You get exactly what it says you get. Would buy again!",

I purchased a phone and upon receiving it I noticed the charging port cap was broken off. I believe this would allow dirt and moisture in. The phone also had all the personal family photos of the gentlemen who previously owned the phone still on it ! Well, I received a call from the owner of the company apologizing. He said that he would replace the phone for free and all I had to do was send back the 1st one. He stated he did not want to discipline any employees as he did not want to hurt their feelings , and that he was just trying to earn a buck. WHAT? I received the new phone , and noticed the back of the phone where the battery sits had dirt and sand in it. I received an email from him stating that ,it was funny that I received 2 phones like that. I offered to send photos of the phone to him. He said to keep both phones. My response to him was that I did not think he would be in business very long.",

It truly is rugged and I am very hard on phones. The Convoy I use now was left out in the rain in a puddle for a week before I rescued it and, after an hour or two on the charger, it immediately powered up. If you want a phone that is resistant to being dropped on concrete or into a pan of hot dishwater (done both), you'll love the Convoy. Old-fashioned...yes...my kids make fun of me for carrying it, but I was getting tired of constantly buying new phones. I will continue to use the Samsung Convoy until I am forced to switch to a \"smarter\" cell phone with a pricey data plan (which I have no doubt will eventually happen) but the batteries for this cell phone are cheap and stay charged for a week. Show me a smart phone that can do that.",

            "body": "Purchased used from NuTwo on Amazon. It was rated as in \"very good\" condition. I would rate it as in excellent condition. The packaging was professional / good quality. The phone arrived ahead of schedule. Highly recommend seller. Now to the phone itself: *Speech / Sound: Very clear sound quality, even the speakerphone mode is very clear with minimum distortion when volume @ max Contacts on other end of phone conversation have indicated they can hear me very clearly w/ good tone & no distortion. Has option to answer call & talk w/ flip closed. (I really like this option) *Screens / Keypad Inside and outside screens are large enough to read (I'm over 50 and have slightly degraded vision). Font adjustment is adequate. Screens are clear and bright. The phone feels and appears sturdy (not water proof / resistant). The flip screen is easy to open / close. The inside keys are large enough so someone with larger hands won't push extra keys by mistake and someone with less than perfect vision can see them clear enough. The keys have a very good / responsive feel. The software menus are adequately easy to navigate and customize. Camera / MicroSD / USB / Bluetooth: The 2.0Mp camera is good. The camcorder function works well. The only drawback is no flash or light assist. The U660 model has the flash / flashlight. The good news is it's Micro SD slot. I inserted a 16GB Sandisk MicroSD and it worked flawlessly for both pics and camcorder. You are given option to save photos / video to limited internal memory then xfer to SD, or you can set option in phone to automatically save to SD. I have a USB data cable on order and have not tried moving data to PC via USB. I'm hoping xferring contacts will be as easy as the SD setup. There are external keys for taking pics / video without opening phone. This phone is also capable of voice command. I played with it briefly and seems to work o.k. but haven't really been into it yet. The phone has Blue Tooth capability and I do plan on ordering a wireless / hands free headset, I just haven't landed on one yet. **Speakerphone is good for voice, but if you're going to play tunes you might want to consider decent headphones or play on other audio device. I plugged in mid-grade headphones and tunes sounded good. Internet: This phone is 3G. Aside from that I can't say much other than it appears to work well. I really don't browse the net on phone, I use PC for that. Carrier compatibility: The phone I purchased is a Verizon / contract (not pre-paid) / CDMA / no simm card / clear ESN. **This phone IS compatible with Calif. Lifeline through ReachOut (Nexus owns ReachOut / Verizon owns Nexus) Cons: *No Cam light (U660 has light) *Vibrate mode a little wimpy, could be slightly stronger Conclusions: Great phone for us \"throw back\" flip phone users who aren't ready for a smart phone yet. This phone has more capability than I will ever use. I have only scratched the surface of the software options.",

            "body": "This purchase has been an outstanding experience. This is the same model phone that Consumer Reports rated a best buy at the time I bought it the first time 10 years ago or more. Customer reviews of subsequent models have said that this one is the best. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a rugged phone with great voice quality and a lit keypad with keys big enough for my big hands. By rugged I mean that I dropped my first one on the floor a number of times over the years without breaking it. I got Verizon on the phone and made sure my contacts were backed up and then activated the phone. Easy! As for TargetWireless, I started by asking them a question. I had an answer back within two hours. I ordered the phone. They shipped it the same day. It arrived earlier than promised, looking new in a small white box with places for the phone and charger, both in little plastic bags. It even has clear thin protective covers on the displays! It seems every bit as good as the one I bought new years ago. Thank you!\u00a0Samsung Convoy SCH-U640 Cell Phone Ruggedized PTT 2+ megapixel Camera for Verizon",

Just the same, it's useless at the moment and I'm rather irritated at having paid as much when I could have gotten something better and more to the point, one that came with everything I needed to be able to use it. The seller was correct on everything else; it is exactly as advertised. Just make sure you get the damn charger.",

Only thing that disqualified from being \"New\" was not coming in retail packaging. Phone arrived in an anti-static shock-absorbing sleeve with a nicely packaged charger, headset, and battery. My local store gave me a SIM card and activated it on my account in no time I was up and running. Super happy with the purchase especially for the price, and I don't think there's anything the S4 isn't capable of that the newest smartphones are, other than spontaneous combustion. Seems that some of the issues people have been having with international devices is probably related to the seller -- would probably be good to check their page before purchasing. I'm more than satisfied.",

            "body": "Ok most of the reviews I went here aren't really covering anything except for \"the price\" and other un related stuff. Anyways I'm coming off of a iphone 4s and I've had experience w/ android and apple devices. Also I work as an IT. Don't worry I'm not gojng to tech speak you to death. Pros: Pretty decent speed. Battery lasts a while under certain usage (I'll cover the bad in the con). But for the most part, I'll go to the gym etc for a few of hours and It'll still be in the high 90's. Iphone would be 70% or lower. The Android experience is pretty good on this phone. The graphics and video are also nice as well. Keeps better track of emails than my iPhone and computer. Although my iphone gets emails 5 sec earlier. Ummm kind of a good work phone. Well its good in the aspects of continuously staying in contact w/ others. It's actually starting to read my mind on things. And I like some of the functions where it accommodates to you. Cons: Battery life. If you're plugged into the computer and using it for certain things, you can actually use more power than it's charging with. In other words you may still be draining power while charging on the computer. During some times when constantly using this, it will take a big chunk. But not as much as the iPhone. The speaker/audio is pretty poor. At work we tried to use it on a speaker mode so me and a coworker could hear a project manager and it was just bad. Normally I use earbuds w/ a mic in it. Sprint sucks... I had to contact BBB again about them... again. It's kind of not a good work phone in the aspect of the camera isn't as detailed/clear as the iPhone one is. Iphone I would take pics and/or scans of documents then send them out. This one, its more of a hassle. Doesn't quite do it or it requires more takes. I still keep my iPhone around. Has too many functions that rely on gps, giving out signals, locations etc. It's annoying at times; only cause I don't like things like that. Has alot of functions but a good amount are hidden or should just be categorized better. Had to ummm do a little work on it so I can have a little more freedom with it. (Not rooting). Etc: Rooting: Rooting (even one click), is illegal and will void your warranty. Also if you're a newb you may do something that will brick your phone. Keep in mind that there's also chances that your phone will be glitchy, turn evil, be vulnerable etc. Always back up your info yada yada. Also don't be an idiot and brag about it on here. Alot of companies read these ratings, and they can always come up w/ something to block it. In other words, don't mess it up for others. People are perfectly capable of googling.",

So far I have experienced no issues with this phone, other than the wi-fi has a tendency to drop/not maintain connection - even when there is a strong signal. With BT 4.0 (including BLE), Ant+, NFC and IR, this phone has all the connection bells and whistles that you can ask for. Battery life generally lasts about 5 to 6 hours on moderate constant use. The screen is vibrant and responsive and sound quality (through headphones) is fantastic (with the ability to \"tune\" the sound quality to your hearing spectrum.) For the cost, I managed to pick this up for a penny with a 2 year contract renewal through Sprint. Well worth the upgrade from my previous phone (LG Viper) at that price point. Unless you absolutely need all the bells and whistles that the newest generation phones are coming with (looking at you Galaxy S5) this one will more than meet the needs of the average consumer.",

            "body": "Overall, the phone is not bad, though there are a couple of issues which, if I had known about ahead of time, may have put me off buying it. I have been a loyal Samsung user for my past three phones, and have liked them up to this one. First, there is a lot of bloatware that can't be gotten rid of without rooting and breaking warranties. More frustrating, with this phone Samsung has taken away the ability to turn some of those apps off, even if you can't get rid of them. In my last phone, a Note 2, I could turn off/disable the Samsung calendar. I much prefer Google's calendar app. In this handset, not only can I not turn off the Samsung calendar, it is constantly changing its settings AND Google calendar's. I try to turn the S calendar notifications off, and it turns them back on without warning. This would be bad enough, but it also turns off my Google calendar notifications, and changes the starting day of the week, the week number showing, and the default notification time. The Samsung calendar is like a virus that won't go away and can't be removed that seeks out any other calendar app and tries to override it. I tried the app \"S Planner Killer\", but I still have to go through with every reboot and put the calendars back to my preference and force stop the Samsung calendar. If you can live with this, the S4 handset is a fine one, it's a standard smart phone. Great camera, though I don't like how Samsung has changed how it works, the size and weight are nice, and it seems to handle everything else just fine.",

            "body": "I LOVE my GS4! It boot so far and runs so fast! I also think it's essential that it has a microSD slot and a removable battery. This is the reason I chose Samsung over HTC. My previous phone was an HTC and it did have a microSD slot and removable battery but with the One series they chose to follow Apple with a sealed unit, which was a deal-killer for me. I never have to worry about battery life as I always have a spare battery charged in my pocket and I have battery chargers at home and at work as well as wireless chargers at home and at work. I pretty much swap batteries whenever my phone drops below 30-40% battery. Swapping and rebooting takes just seconds and them I'm back at 100%. I have a 64GB microSD and it's awesome but I do wish I could get a 128GB. I have a TON of music on it (about 470 albums). By comparison, I recently got my wife the iPhone 5s 32GB and I am unable to even put 120 albums on that before it's filled up. My main complaint about the GS4 is that the power button is on the side. It should be on the top as I bump it a lot accidentally with it being on the top. I am curious what'll happen if and when Samsung comes out with a flexible phone. I hope they'll still be able to offer a removable battery and microSD slot. Incidentally, the camera on this phone is amazing! It's definitely the best small camera I've ever used. The only thing that does better for me is my SLR but that's too much to lug around. Also, the sound quality on the GS4 using Viper4Android and my Philips headphones cannot be beat!",

            "body": "I actually don't use my phone much. That means that if I leave it sitting around unused for, say, 24 hours, I want there to be significant juice left. My previous phone, the SII, even after the installation of a new OEM battery, could barely last 24 hours while it idled. That meant that my phone owned because I had to always make sure it was plugged in. Thus, I'm quite pleased with the S4. It idles much more efficiently (and or has a bigger battery) to the point that a single charge can last 72 hours or so (as I write this, my phone has been unplugged for 44 hours and has 39% battery remaining). In addition, the S4 is snappy and very useable when I need it. The Sprint 4GLTE network coverage leaves much to be desired, but that's not the phone's fault. On the downside with Android, I worry that future updates to the OS will slow down the phone and drain the battery (as seemd to happen with the SII). But that hasn't happened yet and I'm very pleased with my purchase.",

The camera quality is also amazing, there are lots of effects that will sharpen the image and the screen is very glossy and sharp. I love just about everything when it comes to this phone.

I've had mine for 6 months and up until yesterday was very happy with it... then yesterday I took it out of my pocket, and the screen had a crack UNDERNEATH the gorilla glass and would not turn on. (I keep my phone in a UAG case, and have never dropped it. it is still in pristine condition, besides the cracked display. Also, I'm not one to wear skintight jeans- so I never thought this would be an issue.) After a quick Google search, it appears this issue is very common, and Samsung will do nothing about it. Getting a new display means paying $250 (because there is a shortage of S4 displays... I can't imagine why). DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG UNTIL THEY FIX THIS ISSUE!

As far as the phone goes I seem to not get strong signals and drop calls a lot. And the battery life is not as good as I hoped, requiring a charge before the end of the day.",

            "body": "My phone prior to this was the Galaxy S2. You'd expect newer hardware to be better and the S4 doesn't disappoint. But, I feel like the overall experience is greatly improved in the S4. I never felt like the Andriod OS functioned well on the S2, but the Android on the S4 is great. I also seemed to have a lot of random app issues on the S2 that I don't experience on the S4. I was fairly happy with the S2, but never felt like it was a phone that I would keep. As long as some major change doesn't happen, I can see going a few years past my contract expiration before getting a replacement for the S4. Great phone, highly recommend.",

It would even discharge when plugged in. I plug it in with like 50% battery and come back an hour later and the phone is dead and the battery completely drained. I constantly had to reset the phone. I sent it back to Samsung. The only reason I do not give this phone one star is because when it does work: The screen is fantastic and I really enjoy the OS. I also find the IR very useful.",

Another big factor that I didn't see reviewed anywhere else is the fact that the phone charges up extremely quick. You would think with such a huge battery that it would take forever to charge, however this is not the case at all. It takes less than two hours to go from a low charge to fully charge. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a new high end phone. You won't be disappointed. Who cares if it is made of plastic? Everyone has a phone case so it really doesn't matter.",

Overall great product at an AWESOME price. Activation was tricky as they link the phone to your account upon purchasing, but do not activate it. When you try to activate it says its already linked to an account. A call or trip in to customer service is required to have the detached then reattached as active on your account.",

            "title_review": "Big upgrade, so far a big fan",
            "body": "I just upgraded from the original HTC Evo to the Galaxy 4S. I did love my Evo, but oh my what an improvement! So far (6/5/13) I have only had it one day, but I'll update as I continue to use it. Purchase and shipping: At $149.99 this was the cheapest place for the S4, beating Best Buy and Sprint.com by $100. The phone arrived exactly when it was estimated to. Not a bump or bend on the phone's box, which tells me it was protected perfectly. Hint: no, you are not purchasing a new contract when you check out. It told me that the phone comes with a $110/month contract, but Amazon doesn't actually sell you a contract. You're simply obligated to open one with Sprint. So for upgraders, don't fret, you're not going to be charged an additional $110 for this purchase. Out of the box: This phone is incredibly slim and lightweight. I'm constantly worried I'm going to drop it! The black is this beautiful, sophisticated metallic pattern, the edges banded in brushed aluminum, and the face (what isn't the screen) is a similar brushed aluminum pattern overlayed with a dot grid. All of this texture/patterning is quite subtle but adds a beautiful effect of quality. Yes, I know the back is plastic. But unless you're going to be tapping on it all the time, it feels 100% solid and except for not having the chilled feel of real metal, you'd never know it's plastic. There's no clicking corners, no gaps in the body. no sharp edges to catch stuff on. All of the physical buttons (power, volume and home) are very low profile, but easily accessible. Overall it is a very sleek and professional-looking phone. I couldn't tell you how long exactly that it took to charge the first time. I left the house after about an hour and a half, but when I came back it was fully charged after three hours on the charger. It's easy to activate - just go to sprint.com/activate and you'll chat with a representative. FYI to those who are on family plans but are not the account holder: you will need either the account holder's PIN or the answer to their security question. I'm not sure what happened, but mine did not activate the first time, the rep had me do some sort of reset, and it worked the second time. YOU WILL NEED ACCESS TO WIFI. I don't know why, but it would not let me skip a set up with the home wifi network. So make sure you have the network password in hand to complete initial setup. If you set it up with an existing Gmail account, make sure to log in and turn OFF 2-step verification if you have it enabled. Either that or print out the provided PINs, or have access to the specified back-up phone. Otherwise it will block you from proceeding further, until you verify the phone. First day: As with all phones, there is a lot of bloatware. I went through the App Manager and deleted everything I could, then opened Apps > menu button > Hide applications to remove the rest of them. For example, I use the Gmail app and not the Email app, so I hid the latter. Same with Chrome and IE. The apps aren't deleted, so if later you decide, say, you really do want to use the S Health app, just go to Apps > menu button > Show hidden applications to put it back in the main app menu. To get the \"Life Companion\" message off the lock screen, go to Settings > Lock screen widgets > clock or personal message, and edit as you want. Most of the personalization and adjustment is pretty intuitive. Hold your finger down to move the widget, or on a picture to crop or delete. For those who want a little more control, you can open the Developer Options by going to settings > more > About device and tapping 7 times on Build number. Honestly, though, there's not much there the average user would want to mess with. The phone fits in my pocket pretty easily. Now, I'm a girl, and it's saying something when a phone can fit in girls' jeans pockets. But I wear plain ol' bootcut, so for you girls who wear the low-rise or hip-hugger jeans with teeny tiny pockets, I can promise that this phone won't fit. I've been messing with this phone since about 7pm yesterday. Even after being on a lot, playing games, and general first-day fidgeting with it, the battery is only down to 28% now that it's 4pm. That's fairly impressive, especially since it's been kicking on and off roaming in my concrete box of a building that I work in. Note, though, that I do turn off 3G/4G, wifi, bluetooth, NFC, etc. out of habit when I get to work, since it's just useless. And I must say, having the shortcut buttons placed already in the drop-down notifications menu is quite convenient! (Settings > my device > display > notification panel) Update 6/21/13: I am still in LOVE with this phone. The screen is beautiful, the body is beautiful, it responds wonderfully to touch, and it does everything I ask it to in the blink of an eye. I did end up turning off Air Gestures. There's not much use for it other than when in the browser or gallery, and I just found it a little clunky. You have to do specific gestures over a sensor at the top. The only one I really liked anyways was that you could swipe your palm over the phone while it's off, and the screen would show the time and any notifications. Likewise, Smart Screen is off as well... mostly because I just don't want that sensor eating battery all the time. Update 10/17/13: Yup, I STILL love this phone. I can actually make it 2 or 3 days between charges - remember, though, that I turn off my data connections for half of the day (and considering how easy it is to turn them off and on, I would suggest anyone looking to stretch battery life consider doing that too.) Now that my state has banned phone use in vehicles - period - I'm playing with the Driving Mode and S Voice. Yes, you can just click a button, and your phone will become voice activated while you're driving. I wonder how that does when connected to a car via Bluetooth (unfortunately my car does not have Bluetooth :( so sad.) I have an\u00a0OtterBox 77-27604 Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - 1 Pack - Carrier Packaging - Black\u00a0on my phone. It's quite nice, and fits perfectly. I've already dropped the phone a dozen times on concrete and wood floors, both in the Otterbox and in cheaper cases (once flat on the face with no case, on tile), and it has not one scratch or crack. I'm probably just lucky, but it is a testament to the phone that it's not had an issue with the (accidental) rough handling. I'm a tiny bit annoyed that the Home button seems to catch a bit. You know when you click a button and it makes a \"harder\" click than usual, like the mechanism inside is not so smooth? That's what it's doing. Not by much, but noticeable. That is my only annoyance; however, it doesn't affect the functionality or response of the button, and it hasn't seem to have gotten worse in the 2 months since I noticed it, so it's not really important.",

            "body": "I ordered this phone with the highest of hopes. I had gone through 4 years of the ups and downs of HTC products and was ready for a change of pace. I did a lot of research and concluded that the Samsung experiences were pretty good. So when I started to have trouble with this device on the very first day I was more than a little disappointed. To get down to the facts, the WIFI had issues. No matter what WIFI I connected to the phone would randomly disconnect and re-connect. I came to the conclusion that the WIFI was actually turning itself on and off. I poured over the forums and support sites and started to see that Samsung has a history of WIFI issues going back to the S3. But most of these issues had resolutions and were not universal to all types of WIFI as was mine. Everything else about this phone is great and would be greater if I could be on a stable WIFI connection. I've got a replacement coming now as the guys at Sprint were even shocked at how bad this one was. Perhaps when the replacement comes I'll update you. But, watch out for this, if your WIFI is flakey don't put up with it, take it back and get another. Update July 1st, 2013 Sprint replaced the device. It was of note that the failed device was model SPH-L720BKK, the new (or replacement) device was SPH-L720BKX. The replacement works perfectly so far. This was the experience I had hoped for with this device. Happy at last.",

Then on top of the crap your provide put there is also all the dumb apps the samsung put on this phone, trust me if you go with any go with the HTC one i have had both and i should have kept my HTC one. This phone freezes and is so slow in comparison to the HTC one. Not to mention the power saving mode on this compared to the HTC. The Power saving mode on this phone just makes it run even slower. I hate it. I mean i really f8|*|***G hate all the apps this phone has and how slow they make the phone run. GO WITH ANYTHING BUT THIS!!!!. Sure the htc one doesnt have the expansion, but who cares when any time you have to access the SD card the phone becomes so much slower. I would never recommand this to anybody and i will never buy another Samsung phone after this NEVER!!!! this is horrible.",

            "body": "I upgraded from the Nexus S 4G on Sprint, which is several generations old now, and this is a large improvement. My main concern was that it wasn't going to fit in my pockets (I'm an adult male who wears standard jeans), but it fits easily. The reason it fits so well is that it's a lot slimmer than my old Nexus S. So that's not a worry. Everything on the phone works great. It's blazingly fast. I can finally play Temple Run 2 without intermittent stutter (which is a death sentence in that game). Just a tip though, trash the Sprint and Samsung apps and stick with the Google ones. There's no reason to use the Samsung mail app over Google's Gmail app, and the Sprint and Samsung app stores are just pathetic. S Health is a cool idea. I love having a pedometer always on in my pocket. I don't know if it's actually making me walk more than I otherwise would, but it's fun to have metrics on it at least. Unlike other people I don't have any complaints about the phone's aesthetics whatsoever. I like that it's plastic. Plastic is an amazing material that's not as fragile as glass (cough cough iPhone 4) and is lighter than metal. I also find it awesome that my phone shipped with a link to install BaconReader (a mobile app for Reddit) on one of the home screens. Someone at Sprint must be a Redditor.",

            "body": "Bought this phone to upgrade from my old school Gravity T phone of 3 years and I certainly do not regret it. I have Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 and an ASUS TF300 tablet, so the learning curve for this was non-existent for me (which was the contrary for my mother, who upgraded to an HTC One, disliked it and the size and switched to an iPhone *sadface*). The Good: Large Screen - Nice large screen to do whatever you want Sheer Speed - A quad core processor in a phone SD Card - I bought this to replace both my phone and Mp3 player. This phone does the trick with a 64GB optional SD card. I currently have a 32GB in there filled with music. The Neutral: TouchWiz - Most of the additional features that the galaxy offers, like NFC (data exchange for touching devices), S-Beam, Air Gesture, etc I find as gimmicks and are attempted selling points that I never use. The UI is also familiar to most, but I did what I do with any Android deveice: Install Nova Launcher over it. The Bad: Battery Life (initially) - The first two days I owned the phone, I was unhappy with the battery life. I would unplug it from the charger at 7:00 AM before I head to work, and by the time I am done with work at 4:00 PM, it would be down to around 35-40%. I found that Google Services was taking up a lot of battery. I had to do some digging to fix this, but I disabled all google account syncing except for Contacts and Calendar, since the constant syncing can wake up the device to perform its tasks. I also disabled Google Maps from automatically updating its location and disabled Google Now. I also set my email to update less frequently (from 5 minutes (lol) to 30 minutes) and set it to store less emails, thus reducing the time the email app must have a \"wakelock\" to do its business. In short, it was a few headaches to get the battery life to a satisfactory level for me. Storage Space - 16Gb, of which roughly half of it was taken for Samsung's implementation of Android and TouchWiz. Slightly annoying...almost as bad as Microsoft taking up half of 64GB for their implementation of Windows 8 Touch. Overall, I love the S4 and am glad I upgraded. When I got my S4, my mom upgraded to an HTC One, so I had time to compare the two juggernauts of the Android market and I can honestly say, though both have their pros and cons, I love my S4 (All the HTC has going for it are the good camera in dark conditions and the dual audio speakers).",

            "body": "UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware. I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life. Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left. Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand. ---------------------- It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome. My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands. I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges. I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5. I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone. Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone. My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life. These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones: Pros: -Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp. The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching. I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people. -Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI. -Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone. -Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself. -Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible. -Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that. -Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone. -Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year. I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user! Cons: -None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone. Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands. It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S4 will be the best phone of 2013, mark my words!",

            "body": "I was finally eligible for an upgrade on 9/1 so I shopped around and found a great deal at Sam's Club: $148.88 + tax on the sales price, NOT the full retail value. Setup was incredibly simple and FAST. I have had this phone for a week now and I can honestly say the S4 is simply awesome. I can't find anything wrong with it! The screen is gorgeous, the speed is amazing and there are so many features, most of which I haven't even begun to play with. I do love airview/air gesture (hand waves control gallery picture movement, text scrolling, etc). I haven't really played with eye movement control yet but the feature seems way cool. I had considered the LG G2 since it has a Snapdragon 800 and is somewhat faster and has a slightly larger screen but Sprint had other ideas. They won't even start shipping the phone until 'sometime around the holidays'. I was willing to take on those funky buttons on the back of the phone but not if I have to wait for it so FORGET IT. Besides, a friend has an S4 so now we can do the 'pnone bumb' to swap pics, music, etc. It really works! It's not quite as fast as the commercial would have you believe but it's fast enough and there were several very jealous iPhone owners who saw us do it! Now that I have the phone, I REALLY don't regret going for it and not waiting for the LG G2. The phone is light, the battery lasts WAY longer than my HTC EVO 3D's did (loved that phone, despised the lack of battery power). Regarding Touchwiz, yes there are lots of haters out there and yes the phone has plenty of bloatware running in the background. BUT you can force stop those apps and they stay dormant until you power down. They come back like a bad penny so don't power down! Also, I have a Samsung Note tablet (running Android 4.1) so I am really familiar with Touchwiz. One of the biggest selling points for me was the removeable battery and SD card. The previous knock was you can't move apps to the SD card....only files. Guess what? I just downloaded an update and now you can move apps to the SD card so the 16gB RAM is no longer a limiting factor. Also, Sam's Club has a two-year insurance plan through SquareTrade for $99 with a $49 deductible. That deal can't be beat. One caveat: you can only get that deal in-store. BOTTOME LINE: the S4 will blow you away. All who see it suddenly want one....especially the Apple fanboys and fangirls! When you demo it for them, they turn green with envy! What better reason than that to get this phone?! :)",

As I was writing this, I was paying attention to the battery loss and over a period of 1 hour (while doing nothing except apps in the background [email mostly]) and it lost about 8% battery for the hour. I love that I can customize by screens to be literally anything that I want! I have folders that I can name anything that I want, I can set my background as a moving background or a single picture, I can download more apps for free than I have need for, and I can customize everything! For people that are tech savvy, this is a GREAT phone. For people that have a couple hours when they first get it and are willing to sit down and learn it, it's an excellent choice. For people that want a basic phone with little ability to customize it to exactly what you want, go with the iPhone. I have had some problems with it as far as service goes, but I don't believe that's the fault of my phone, I believe that's the fault of Sprint who has been \"upgrading the network\" in my area.",

            "body": "This review is for the black mist 16GB Galaxy S4 for Sprint. I recently switched to this phone after having the Galaxy Note 2. I love both phones and the Note had that glorious screen and built in S-Pen. But, for me, as a phone, the Note is just a bit too big for my personal taste and I found the call volume to be weak even with sound boost. So I moved to the S4, thinking it would give me most of the benefits of the Note in a more compact package. After a couple of weeks using this I can tell you it is a fantastic phone. I am running the latest version of KitKat and this phone is smooth as silk with little to no lag. The screen is gorgeous, the size is perfect, and the call quality is outstanding. This is my fourth Samsung phone and I understand some the critics complaining about TouchWiz, battery life, etc. Here's a couple of simple things I did : I downloaded Nova Launcher and run it as my main launcher. Is very smooth and fast. Secondly, the stock battery, quite frankly, is lousy. I purchased two after market batteries and a charger from Amazon then purchased an extended 5200 mah battery as well. I am currently using one of the standard size batteries and still at 20% life after almost eleven hours. That is excellent. Screen brightness maxed, bluetooth on, etc. Moderate to heavy usage. So, while the stock battery isn't that good, the phone itself doesn't just suck the juice. A better battery makes a world of difference. This is the best phone I've had in Sprint. Period.",

            "body": "Don't buy this phone or any other Samsung product until you check out all of the complaints on the Web. My Samsung Galaxy S4 only worked right until the warranty expired. After one year it started having serious problems. Several times a day it freezes up and I get the Message: Unable to detect SIM card. RESTART. This sometimes happens in the middle of using it for email, etc. Most of the time though it is in my pocket unable to received calls, messages or alerts until I take it out and realize it has shut down without my knowledge. I'm not alone. The web is full of reports of this problem. Samsung does not care if you are out of warranty. I went to my service provider when the problem first occurred and they acknowledged that it is a widespread problem. They installed a new SIM card without charge, but the problem recurred before I left the mall. I went back to my service provider, but they said they had no solution. I've tried various fixes that are talked about on the web, but none of them work. Because it has been less than 2 years since I bought the phone, I cannot replace it with a subsidized price. I can't afford to pay full price for a new phone, so I am stuck with this one working only 1/2 the time.",

            "title_review": "Awesome phone for everyone!!",
            "body": "Me and my mom were both upgrading our phones for Christmas, I consider myself a smartphone junkie so I went with the juggernaut of a phone that is the note 3. However, for my mom I suggested she get the S4 over the note 2 she originally wanted. I did this for a few reasons. The S4 is much newer than the note 2 and after having an infuse 4g for the past 2 years a nice new phone was much needed! Another reason I suggested the S4 was due to its size. My mom is about 5'7\" and I figured the 5 inch form factor was much better for her than the somewhat unwieldy size of the note 2 or note 3. When it comes to screen my mom is more than pleased. She immediately commented on the clarity and color saturation before she even was finished setting up her google account. It is a gorgeous display. There is no other way around that. So far she has had it for about a week and has experienced nothing in the way of lag. Of course my mom barely knows that games exist on android much less the fact that you can play some graphically intense ones so she isn't really putting the phone to huge processor loads but it Is working great even if it is just a Snapdragon 600 compared to a snapdragon 800. Overall my mom loves her phone. That brings me to who this phone is for. The s3 was praised due to the fact that it was made for everyone and I think the s4 is in the same boat. If you are a spec hungry person that needs the most powerful phone and actually knows the difference between the snapdragon 600 and 800 then you really don't need this review, but for everyone else who just needs a phone that works well in everyday use, that looks gorgeous this is the phone for you.",

            "title_review": "Loaded with crap out of the box, but not bad after some changes",
            "body": "Do you remember that YouTube video showing what an iPod box would look like if it was made by Microsoft? The dozens of stickers and certifications and advertisements? That's what this phone feels like out of the box. It's overwhelmed with Samsung stuff, much of which serves only to drain the battery or change Android for no particular reason. The phone actually lagged and stuttered from the get-go. That's a hell of an achievement for a quad-core handset with 2GB of RAM. Since I came from a Galaxy S running Cyanogen, that just wouldn't do. SPEEDIFYING THE S4: The first step was to gain full control by rooting it. Google 'qbking77 galaxy s4 root' for an easy guide. Step two was to install 'NoBloat Free' and start disabling all the Samsung background nonsense. Search '[ROM]broodROM S4 RC1' and click the first link for a list of what's safe to ditch. Don't permanently delete anything; you'll need to re-enable these later to apply Samsung's over-the-air updates. Step three was to change the animation speed for the UI under Developer Options. To enable Developer Options, go to System Settings -> More -> About Device, scroll down, and tap on build number five or ten times. Then back up, go into Developer Options, and change the three 'X scales' near the bottom from 1X to 0.5X or Off. Step four was to ditch the TouchWiz launcher and use Nova Launcher instead. It's like a pumped-up version of the stock Android launcher and very fast. The free version does everything you'll need. Step five was to disable NFC, S Beam, Bluetooth, and so on. All that stuff is lovely, but leaving it on when you don't need it (Bluetooth in particular) does nasty things to your battery life. If you want idle time measured in days, disable location services in the Maps app. If you get 'Media Server' taking up your battery, install Rescan Media Root. That's it for performance. The phone is fairly quick now. It has about 900 MB of free memory and, if left idle, will sit for about 80 hours before the battery dies. After that, I installed a couple of useful apps like Screen Filter (to dim the screen even more at night), Waze (which has traffic rerouting and police alerts and makes my Garmin feel a million years old), F-Droid (an alternative app store that'll let you install things like AdAway) and so on. Update-- out of annoyance with inconsistent performance even after many of these tweaks, I switched to CyanogenMod 10.1. It's not quite as stable as the stock Samsung firmware, but it's so much faster. BUILD: It's a pretty handset and shockingly thin. It almost disappears even in tight (for a guy) jeans. It's also incredibly slippery. I nearly dropped it twice setting it up. Unlike my Samsung Epic (which had the delightful feature of falling into pieces when dropped and not breaking), you can crack the screen easily, so buy a case. I vowed I wasn't going to bother since the Epic never needed one. I've done a 180. After trying a few, I've been very happy with Spigen's Ultra Fit in high-grip matte black. The phone is much easier to grip now with minimal changes in thickness. Review sites say the HTC One is a prettier fetish object. I agree it feels better in hand, but there's a caveat: it can't be dismantled. If you drop it or mess up the charging port, Sprint can't fix it onsite. They have to send it back to HTC. The HTC is also chunkier, for better or worse. The screen is near-perfect. It'd be totally perfect if not for the high power use displaying white and pleasing, though somewhat inaccurate color. You'll want to use dark or night themes whenever possible. Pixels are invisible. Blacks are pitch even in darkness. The size is just on the border of too large for one-handed use. I'm over six feet with commensurately-sized hands, and pressing the side Power button while bracing with a pinky is a slight stretch. A five-foot friend loves her Note II, though, so if you're willing to treat it two-handed like a tablet, any hand size will do. AS A PHONE: Samsung included a useful app (perish the thought!) called 'Adapt Sound'. It's under System Settings -> My Device -> Sound, at the bottom. It'll test your hearing and change the frequency response of the phone to suit it. The app significantly improved the intelligibility of conversations to me. Much, much better than the Galaxy S. I did have some trouble integrating Google Voice. Sprint has a Visual Voicemail app ('VTT') with a three month trial that kept coming back from the dead and showing me old voicemails. The solution was to press and hold the Voicemail app icon from Nova Launcher and drag it up to 'Manage App' on the top left. Then I pressed 'Disable' and agreed to all the prompts when it asked to uninstall itself. Now the voicemail button in the dialer calls Google Voice. Voicemails are also transcribed and sent to my inbox per usual. TEXT INPUT: This is my first handset without a hardware keyboard. It's been a surprisingly smooth transition to screen typing. Hardware keyboards work really well for idiosyncratic speech and punctuation. If you're sufficiently pedantic to chafe at the thought of accidentally using the wrong quote marks or comma placement, no software keyboard will be a true panacea. But some are better than others. The most clever of them all is SwiftKey. First, because it'll let you seamlessly switch from tapping letters to gesture-style word tracing. Second, because it has the best text prediction, because it scrapes your email, Facebook, text messages, and Twitter to compile a personalized library of what you actually say. That one word you made up that doesn't exist in any dictionary? If you've ever used it anywhere, SwiftKey will predict it. That extends to full sentence constructions. In practice, I use word-tracing in portrait mode and rely on SwiftKey to guess correctly. With just GMail and Facebook in the database, it does so about 90% of the time if my tracing is even vaguely on point. For more unique words, I switch to landscape and use that larger keyboard to accurately touch-type. As SwiftKey learns, I find myself doing this less often. In a car, I rely on Google's voice recognition, which is superb when it works (most of the time), but often requires saying the same thing twice to fix an error six words earlier. All of this is noticeably easier on the S4's 5\" screen than it ever was on the Epic's 4\" screen. My iPhone friends continue to amaze me with their speed and accuracy, but with my large thumbs, I couldn't duplicate that with a screen keyboard on any handset before this one. ACCESSORIES: The 2.1 amp wall charger charges at 1% per minute, so a little under two hours for a full charge. Beware off-brand and car chargers. I discovered the phone charges in one of two modes: USB computer mode and dumb charger mode. USB mode (where it assumes the output device is a computer) only gives 0.5A (to stay within the USB spec), so the phone will take all night to charge. But it'll pull 2 amps or more from a dumb charger if you're not using a super-skinny USB cable. The problem is, there are two ways to make a charger appear 'dumb', and they're incompatible. The Apple way (implemented by most chargers) won't fast-charge this phone. The other way (shorting the two middle USB data pins) will, but few chargers actually use this technique (thanks to Apple's popularity). The upshot is, unless you're buying branded accessories specifically for Android phones, you're probably going to have to do minor surgery on any of the cheaper chargers you buy. SHOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONE? Maybe. The S4 has some impressive hardware and a best-in-class screen, but the phone experience is dictated by Android. And Android is hit or miss. This phone, after I've tweaked the hell out of it, is occasionally faster than an iPhone. More often, it isn't. The iPhone screen lights up faster when you press the power button. There's very little delay after you press an app, and very little more in showing content within the app. The UI animations are smooth. Android is none of these things, and more noticeably, it's not consistent. Sometimes it's very fast, sometimes it lags, and you'll never have any idea why. And then there's the micromanagement. I'm happy that I discovered how to disable the background media scanner that was cutting 30 hours of my idle time, but I shouldn't have to do that. Windows Phone 8 is right up there with the iPhone in responsiveness. Better, even, and with a novel and impressive UI that integrates many social media functions independent of separate apps. The Windows app store is lackluster, though, and the OS itself is harder to hack if that's what you're about. You really have to be happy with how the phone works out of the box. The hardware also lags behind Android handsets, but you won't ever notice (except in some games) because the OS is so fluid. And it has terrific Exchange support for business users. For most people, unless there's a compelling need for a large screen or Android's greater abilities once rooted, the iPhone is simply better than even this S4. It doesn't require any of the tweaking I've outlined, nor the low-level task management that seems to crop up so often even with Android 4. Likewise, the Windows Phone ecosystem isn't sufficiently mature to recommend that one over the iPhone. But if you want Android and you're willing to unlock the full potential of it, the S4 is as good as it gets for this screen size.",

            "body": "I recently exchanged my HTC Evo Shift for the Galaxy S4 with Sprint. There's been plenty of techy info posted, so I'll keep this to the point. (I'm an average cellphone user; a Smith). There were several reasons I personally chose the Galaxy S4... 1. I prefer a plastic cover on the back. Unlike an aluminum/metal cover, plastic doesn't transfer as much heat and easy access to #2 below. 2. Replaceable battery. 3. Expandable memory via MicroSD card to hold my music and pictures/videos. 4. The 5\" screen using the same demensions as similar smartphones with smaller screen sizes. 5. I thought about staying with HTC and getting the HTC One, but I wouldn't use the live feeds on its Home Screen. Live feeds probably drain the battery, too. I just don't do social networks, etc. (In fairness, some reviews said you can bypass that Home Screen.) The Galaxy S4 screen is flawless and vivid. The Galaxy S4 is much larger than the HTC Evo Shift it replaced, but it's lighter and much thinner. It took no time to prefer the larger S4. The camera is amazing; no shutter lag, crystal clear images, and many multiple options. Call quality, sound, reception has been fantastic. No problems with data usage, GPS, etc. The one gripe I have isn't with the Galaxy S4, it's with the Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean). ANY smartphone running Android 4.1 or higher (that's all the new phones out now... Samsung, HTC, LG, etc.) don't have a Flash Player Plug-in for web content. Adobe decided it would stop making their flash player plug-in available for devices running higher than Android 4.0... Android 4.0 is the last version the plug-in is available for. I've been looking and looking, there's no app out right now for this issue. I contacted Samsung directly; they recommended downloading Macromedia Player on Google Play... uh... Macromedia is now Adobe. So for now, once in a while surfing the Net, you'll come across some flash content the Android 4.1+ can't show. As far as the Galaxy S4 is concerned, it's a cheetah on steroids with the sex appeal of Rita Hayworth and the strength of Hercules. No complaints so far. If there are any longevity issues, I'll post them later on. UPDATE 5/22- Windows users... while the S4 is plugged into your computer and turned on, do a Windows Update. It will find a software/driver update so the S4 is more easily recognized by your computer to upload/download files like a drive. Just follow the recommended installation directions... EZ. UPDATE 5/28- I agree with some other reviewers that the ringer melodies loaded could be louder when the phone rings. I downloaded a free app called Old Phone Ringtones, which has louder-sounding options by the sound they make.",

            "title_review": "Samsung Galaxy S3.5 Might be More Appropriate",
            "body": "I'll start off giving a bit of background on my smartphone usage. I've pretty much been a Droid user for my whole life. I'm definitely a power user and I greatly enjoyed having a keyboard. I could type long text messages or emails with ease, and I never really had that much interest in switching to a non-keyboard phone. Unfortunately, that decision was taken out of my hands somewhat. I have the Droid 4 which I greatly enjoy, but it has it's own problems. After having it for about a year it got a pretty nasty crack on it. I played around with some friends GS3's and was very impressed with them. However the rumors about the GS 4 coming out had already started so I decided to hold off. I'm glad that I did, but a lot of my review will be based off of not having the GS3 and making such a drastic switch. As I put in the title, it seems to be minor improvements upon a design they've found worked as opposed to the drastic changes previously seen. Without further ado... The Looks: There isn't much positive to be said about the aesthetics of the Galaxy S4 body to be honest. It looks and feels like a cheap toy. It feels... clammy might be the best way to describe it. It really isn't the best feel when you're holding it, and compared to the HTC One it's disappointing. It doesn't seem like it had that much effort put into changing it. It does feel sturdy though, despite being a very thin phone. I was able to get a good grip on it though which is important to me since I'm rather small. Overall I would give the looks a 2.5/5 The Hardware: Huge upgrade over.. well anything but a computer. This really is just a small computer, and it runs flawlessly. The screen is massive and great. Easily the best one that I've seen on a phone. The 5\" screen could be a little bit big for some people I think, but for most of the younger generation will be ok with it though. The battery is incredible as well. My Droid 4 would die around 4 or so after a normal days use (streaming music, internet, tons of emails, etc). This will last me all day, including going out at night which is a massive incentive to me. The camera is great on it as well, much better than any other Android phone. It is still slightly edged out by the iPhone though. Overall though I would give it a 5/5 on hardware The Software: I'll start with the obvious, it's actually running the latest version of Jelly Bean, and should keep up better than other phones do (minus Nexus 4.) This is a huge bonus, because Android's because fault is that the OS is so fragmented. Now, Samsung has put a ton of their own software on top of Jelly Bean. The best description would be that it's overwhelming probably. There are a lot of Samsung apps that really will just never be used. So I'm not even going to bother going over the party trick type apps. Instead I'll talk about a few that really caught my attention. S Health: Helpful now, will be awesome in the future. The premise is that it's a basically a fitbit built into your phone. It helps you track calories, steps walked, workouts, etc. It works great now, but I don't think that it will get better with accessories. WatchON: Basically it acts as a universal TV remote and a Netflix browser. It's great, and I don't even watch very much TV. I suspect that this will become the standard soon, but until then this is the best version you can get. Air View/Gesture: A great idea, but not great in practice. It's glitchy currently and doesn't always work (or does work in ways that you don't want it to.) Camera Software: There's actually a lot of really great features that come with the camera. The most novel of them is the ability to take a picture from the front and back cameras at the same time. I can see this actually becoming standard in the future as well. Overall I think that the software is good, but not perfect. Overall I would still rather just have stock jelly bean. Samsung adds some good features, but it also adds a lot of stuff that I really don't need and can't get rid of. Final Impressions: It's a good phone, there's no doubt about that. It's not a great phone though. The screen is amazing, the body isn't. The software is good, the hardware is out of this world. It all comes down to personal preference between this and the HTC One I think. Personally I'm fine just putting a case on my GS 4, but I've always been more interested in battery and hardware. I can completely understand picking a slight downgrade on those areas though in return for a great body like the HTC One has. 4/5",

I am so very disappointed that an expensive phone could break so easily and that the company will not fix it without charging more. I have had other phones that I have dropped and they never broke; but this is ridiculous. Again, very very disappointed with Samsung.",

The way I see it they will be getting their money back in about 6 months and I'll continue being a happy customer. Everybody wins in that scenario. However after being on the phone with sprint for an hour they refuse to see this. They will loose monthly revenue and I'll have to stick with my dumb-phone. I would really like to order this phone and change this review. I just can't do it when they are treating loyal customers as if they are less important than everyone else.",

The battery life was great at the beginning but as time went on it would drain really fast which was disappointing. I upgraded to the S5 when it was released and not only did the S5 have an improved battery life the picture quality was quite impressive compared to the S4. This phone is a nice upgrade from the S3 and as stated previously it still functions 3 years later without skipping a beat.

I also won't be comparing it to the competition, only the other Galaxy S series phones of the past. The phone came in less than 2 days, (I live only about 4 hours from a large amazon warehouse) I had no issues activating it on sprint I use several features on a daily basis, the camera, the gps, various apps and some of the airview features. What works for me: Phone Calls, are definitely better quality than the GS3 The WiFi works with my AC router (newest WiFi standard) Battery life is about 12 hours from 100% to 10% for me GPS is accurate Looking away from video pauses it Doesn't lock up (at least hasn't locked up yet) Charges in less than 4 hours from 10% to full Camera is pretty good (still a bit bad on low light or fast action though) Wireless charging capable (with a separate back-plate or 3rd party adapter, I use an adapter and it works nicely) What doesn't work for me: AirView features are hit/miss even when set up correctly and turned on(I can't get air scroll to work, and even the hover to preview feature only works occasionally) Eye Scroll has never worked along with smart stay, configured and on they just don't seem to like me, (I wear glasses so that may be a factor) Sometimes the power button is slow to respond so I find myself turning the screen on/off multiple times in order to turn the screen on or off. I'll keep updating this review as I find things out, but so far I would call this a 4 star phone, There is plenty of room to improve but many of the things tat bothered me in the GS2 or 3 have been corrected. I'm not going to compare this phone to the competition, the best phone for me may not be the best phone for you, all I can say is this is a good improvement over the other Galaxy S phones of the past.

I bought it for my boyfriend but I currently use it more!We upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to this Galaxy S4, and it is amazing. We love all the additional features to this S4. The package came with the phone, wall charger, charger cord and battery. I did not received the guide for it, which doesn't matter to me. Be warned though. This device needed a SIM card and it did not come with one. The Galaxy S3 from Sprint didn't even use a SIM card. I contacted Sprint about this and they sent me one for free. I am so grateful they did because it really helped me out. The S4 is such a great upgrade from the S3. I love that there is a walking app pre-installed on this phone. It needed an upgrade after we transferred the phone number to the phone. It changed the layout from the familiar S3 to the layout known for S4. We were temporarily confused by the new configuration but acclimated quickly. The battery life so far seems to be less than the S3, however, that could be because this is the first week and we were playing around on it so much.

            "body": "My mother was up for a phone upgrade as her s2 was showing its age. I researched and decided that for the price(1 penny) this phone was a great deal. It is slightly bigger then the s2 but it is much lighter in your hand. It's close to the size that feels awkward in your pocket but she keeps it in her purse most of the time so that's not an issue with her. She's used it for 2 months and so far she likes it, with some drawbacks. 1. It is not as user friendly as an iphone. She has asked me a few times how to do things like turn off 3g and 4g and there seems to be no drop down menu button for that. Battery life is great, but would be even better if there was an easy way to shut off internet. There's one for Bluetooth, WIFI, Sync, and others so why they didn't add it is beyond me. 2. There doesn't seem to be a \"Macro\" mode on this phone. She searched for it and I have too and the solution people say is to use the zoom feature. Coming from an s2 and s3 where there is a dedicated mode it is tricky to get close ups to be sharp like they should for a 13MP camera. Besides those 2 issues she loves her phone and will be happy with it even after she's due for another upgrade.",

            "body": "What can I say, it's a flagship Samsung Galaxy phone. I'm a massive fan of the Samsung OLED screens and this one is 1080p HD, very sharp and of course, bright. Everything is easier on this phone, not the least of which is surfing the internet. Web pages fit much, much better and sideways scrolling is essentially eliminated. I also have a strong 4G LTE signal pretty much wherever I go but this speaks to the service as much as the hardware. I love all the bells and whistles and some are really convenient while others, of course, I don't use much if at all. The features are just too numerous to go into individually. I have a three piece hybrid case on my phone, won't use anything else, and I've dropped it a couple of times, and.....no damage. While the case is largely at play there I also have to believe that the phone is tougher than some others, including the GS3. There's nothing out there that beats the Galaxy S4, except the Galaxy S5.",

Fast, easy to read screen, long battery life, barometer that is pretty accurate when hiking. Like the infrared remote feature to control tvs. Camera is fast. On some tours I was shooting over 300 pictures in 6 hours plus videos. Battery lasted throughout day. Recommend extra battery as having camera on with full screen shooting pictures, zooming, examining photos continuously, then using wifi at hotspots uses battery up in about 8 hours. I have had this for a year now, have 47gb of vids and photos, use it in hot attics. Works perfectly. Useable space is around 80gb on this phone. What is neat is you can put in another chip and battery.",

The temperature sensor is nearly useless as it is measures internal temperature which will be elevated during use of the phone. 4) My wife has the S3 and her charger will not top off my battery (or at least not quickly) charger \"stalled\" at 95% when I tried to use her charger. 5) The Wifi is dual band and can receive the 5 GHz signal 6) The built in alarm clock tones are rather loud for me but I am a very light sleeper",

My father is now posting pictures and videos on facebook, something he hasn't attempted before. Pretty cool if you ask me. The phone has easy-theme settings for first time android users. Also, the quality is samsung quality - something to be sought after. However, I do feel Samsung needs to cast away with the polymer cases on their flagship phones and implement an aluminum body. Overall the performance is solid for out modest multi-media needs. We are not gamers, at least not on the phone, and as such I cannot review this phone on that criteria. One thing to note is you should purchase an additional, or larger battery with external charger. This phone can die quickly- < = 10 hours.",

There was a $36 activation fee, but that would have been applied even if I ordered it through the Sprint website. I will tell you that activating the phone was a breeze, and I was able to do it directly from my phone without a hitch. If you are thinking of getting this amazing phone, grab it while it is virtually free. With my Prime Membership, two day shipping was free as well. You can't beat that!

ONE PENNY. It would've been worth every penny no matter what price I paid, however, I ended up only paying a penny for each phone because of some amazing Amazon Black Friday deal or something. I could not be any happier with the price I paid. I'm proud I found such a steal on an amazing phone. My dad loves his Galaxy as well. We are definitely happy campers. This phone is incredible.

The screen is bigger, but the phone is actually smaller and thinner overall. The build quality is great. High quality plastic is what should be used on a mobile phone to keep it light and so everything bends instead of snaps like on metal or hybrid-ceramic phones. This phone is as light or lighter than the S3, which is great when it sits in your pocket you hardly notice it is there. The screen is absolutely amazing. If the colors are too saturated for you because of the bright AMOLED technology, Samsung has included software to tone down the colors a little or a lot, whatever you want. At 1080p you can view full, regular size webpages and read the smallest text with ease. The battery life is great as well, even at full brightness with heavy screen on time. The included software from Samsung is great, but it does take up some battery life, but you can simply turn it all of to improve battery life if you wish. That is the great thing about this phone and Android. If you don't like something you have full control over your phone and you can change it, unlike other smart phones.",

So much faster with better screen resolution than my aging S3, also its quad core processor and faster graphics capabilities make for a wonderful experience!. A must have for the price of only $49.99 from Amazon Wireless with 2yr contract on the \"Sprint network\". A+++++ as this device should meet my needs for many years to come, plus the fact that I'm in an 4G/LTE market from Sprint. (So I can enjoy all of the benefits of this power house S4)",

They delivered it on time even in the middle of the holiday blitz, and the setup with sprint was a breeze. The experience buying the phone was excellent, and it is amazing.",

I took a chance buying this because of the screen size (instead of the HTC One). And though I'd probably be very happy with HTC One, This thing takes the cake. The camera/camcorder and features are amazing. The Screen is the biggest you're going to get before it starts to feel more like a tablet. Side by side with htc one in overall dimensions, they're about the same size. The screen border is smaller on this thing, only thing that's an issue is if you have a case the protects the front as it makes it harder to touch the edges of the screen. Just 1 thing to keep in mind.",

I continually have connection issues, data transfer issues and hangups. Come to find out, my phone had another number attached. (Repaired phone). Came in a Sprint box like new and the seller said it was a new phone. Now, they know me in the Sprint store on a first name basis. Finally, to fix the problem, I now have to wait for 3 working days for a new phone. Funny thing is, my wife and I did the same deal. Hers works great. So my advice for all is, good luck. Hope yours works better than mine.",

They give you a UPS shipping label for \"2 day air\" service which means they are not in a rush to get your phone back working. Nice big screen. Apps open fairly fast. Long battery duration. I work in a very old building with very poor signal reception. My old device used to be depleted after 4 to 5 hrs. This one still has charge after 8 hrs. The weather widget stopped working for the past few days. It would not update the temperature. Turned out the phone needed to be restarted. I wish the ring volumes were higher. Sometimes I don't notice it is ringing.",

            "body": "Not a whole lot of people are using the latest 802.11ac standard -- AFAIK it isn't finalized yet and is still pricey. However, while the Nexus 5 has no problem with any of the ac routers I've purchased, the Galaxy S4 continues to be a problem. Range seems to be the biggest issue with the GS4 and an ac router -- I can't go more than a few feet away before losing substantial speeds and/or experiencing a complete loss of signal. I tried different routers and different firmwares with the same results and it happened on both of my GS4s. One particular firmware with the Netgear got me a greater range, but stability was much worse with loss of connections every few minutes. I'd like to think it's just a router issues, but the Nexus 5 doesn't have a problem with any router or any firmware version so I'm holding Samsung accountable on this one. Ultimately, I've decided to stick to the 2.4Ghz connection and the phone will work fine, but it's a shame that the 5Ghz ac connection won't work with this phone. Routers Used: Netgear AC1900 R7000 Nighthawk Stock Firmware Versions: V1.0.2.194_1.0.15 // V1.0.2.164_1.0.15 Kong Firmware Versions: 23250 Asus AC1900 RT-AC68R Firmware Version: 3.0.0.4.374_205 My Devices capable of 5GHz: Two Separate Galaxy S4 phones (802.11ac) Nexus 5 Phone (802.11ac) Nexus 7 Tablet (non 802.11ac) Panasonic TC-PST50 Television (non 802.11ac) Symptoms on Netgear AC1900 R7000 with firmware version V1.0.2.164_1.0.15: Galaxy S4 experienced sufficient coverage and speeds on 5GHz network but experienced unreliable connections with random drops occurring every few minutes. Only GS4 would display these issues, Nexus Devices and TV maintained connection to network/internet as well as the 2.4GHz devices and ethernet plugged devices. Symptoms on Netgear AC1900 R7000 with firmware version V1.0.2.194_1.0.15: Galaxy S4 had excellent speed with VERY limited range. Within 5 feet of router, phone obtained maximum connection speeds. After that, every few feet speeds would drop significantly. Once out of the room (less than 15 feet away), the GS4 would lose connection entirely. Nexus devices and TV did not experience this issue. Symptoms on Netgear AC1900 R7000 with firmware by Kong, version 23250: Exact same symptoms and results as with the stock Netgear firmware version V1.0.2.194_1.0.15 -- VERY limited range. Symptoms on Asus AC1900 RT-AC68R with firmware Version: 3.0.0.4.374_205: Exact same symptoms and results as with the stock Netgear firmware version V1.0.2.194_1.0.15 -- VERY limited range. Attempted Fixes: Factory Resets on Routers and GS4 Tried different channels on the router using WiFi analyzer to help choose Specifying Wireless Modes (N+AC, N, Auto, etc) Disabled WiFi Power Save Mode on GS4 Notes: No noticeable issues with the 2.4GHz or wired devices with any router or firmware versions -- though I've been primarily focusing on the 5GHz. Phone: Software Version: MK2, Hardware Version: L720.08, Non Rooted",

            "body": "The Samsung galaxy s4 is by far currently the best cell phone on the sprint network with only the I phone 5 and htc 1 even trying to give it competition. The quad core processor ,amazing screen and long battery life make this the best option for the android lovers out there. Pros: On android. 16gb memory but allows micro sd upgrade unlike iphone 5. Really long battery life quad core cpu with 2gbs of ram. (that's a better computer then most households have anymore) 13 megapixel camera that does amazing close up pictures and decent distant ones. (comparing this to my Nikon d7000) Cons: Slightly larger phone so if you have small hands it may be uncomfortable or easy to drop. Just so you know: Jason bought the black Heather bought the white. We both agree the white looks better even in the cases. Other options: Htc one Iphone 5 For every bit of hype the iphone 5 has the galaxy s4 has the muscle to back it up. While Samsung may not be the marketing firm that apple is they let there products talk for them self. And if you listen you can hear them clearly saying I am a better phone.

            "body": "While there is a lot I like about the phone I had to return it and get it through Verizon instead. Amazon's service was great -- unfortunately the same cannot be said for Sprint. During activation the Sprint gal was having a hard time hearing us... We live in North NJ (not that far from a Sprint tower). Also the next morning at the local grocery store the voice connection was an issue (mother-in-law) couldn't hear my wife. Lastly when my wife took the train from Denville to Summit, NJ the internet froze and went into roaming. Mind you all of these are highly populated areas. While unlmited data sounds great in reality it is a joke. No 4G in most parts of North NJ still June 2013 and voice quality and roaming issues. Signed back up with Verizon and will just limit video and music streaming to WiFi areas. Unlimited isn't worth poor connections -- sorry Sprint I am not paying $150 for 2 phone for unlimited poor connections. Heard the same negative feedback from a colleague in Indianapolis and they are supposed to be already on 4G out there. Guess 4G really doesn't mean great network if you only get it sometimes and drop calls and have garbled conversations frequently.",

            "title_review": "Samsungs flagship phone does not disappoint",
            "body": "I have been with the Galaxy line since the very first one with the sliding keyboard. I had the SI and SII, my brother has the SIII. I would consider myself a seasoned owner who knows the phones well. My SII started getting wonky on me finally so I had to trade up. I considered the HTC One but went with the Galaxy based on my past history with the line. I am extremely happy I did. This phone absolutely blows the SII and SIII out of the water on just about every level. The speed of the phone is great. I was a little worried I was not able to switch off 4G, that was a huge battery killer on my past phones. But it seamlessly switches between networks without you noticing and doesn't drain the battery. Pros: -Does very well at managing battery life. I wake up at 5:30am unplug my phone and go to work. I don't have to plug it in at all during the day. I'll come home at 4:00pm and still have over 70% battery. -Fast opening, switching and closing apps. There is almost no lag between when you touch the app and when it actually opens. -Easy to set up email accounts. I had zero issues getting all my email accounts set up. -Multitasking done right. You can open multiple apps at once and switch between the two easily(ex. looking up an address, typing it in GMaps). -They finally brought back the ability to create folders in the app drawer. Makes it easy to get rid of clutter. -Display is bright and colors are very accurate. The auto dimming display is responsive and it actually works. - Easy to use. If you are familiar with the Galaxy line you will find it easy to transition to this phone. Even if you are not, most of the settings are easy to find and nothing is too buried in the menus. - Expandable memory (HTC One does not have this). - Camera is great and has a lot of features. You need to sit down and play with the camera for a while just to see everything it can do. - Replaceable battery (HTC One is sealed). My SII battery eventually bulged and had to be replaced. The ability to change the battery was a major decision point between the SIV and HTC One. - Inductive charging. The inductive charger back is coming out soon for this phone. Although if you search on ebay you can find the stock back cover with the inductive coil already on it. This one works for the Palm Touchstone which is an awesome little charger. You can fit it in your car cup holder. Cons: - Size: the phone is pretty large. I wish they had went with a 4.7\" screen instead. I compared it to my old SII and it was only slightly taller (~0.25\") but it is noticeably larger to hold. - Gestures: I really dislike the air gesture, and eye gesture crap. You can turn it off though! - Sound is not great but who buys a phone for great sound from a \u00d80.125\" speaker. - Email sync interval for Gmail is always on push. Can't change it to a different interval. - With headphone jack connected a warning message pops up when you go to high on the volume. It doesn't allow you to go any higher until you click OK. This would be easy to close if I didn't have my phone in my motorcycle jacket while traveling at 70mph down the freeway. It is pretty annoying and I hope they patch this eventually. - You can't use data while making a phone call. This is a huge problem if you are talking to someone and want to look something up without first hanging up. I don't know why they didn't enable this on the SIV when all the other ones had it. Again, a software fix can most likely fix this issue. Basically all of the cons can be either turned off or patched with a future update. Overall I am very happy with this phone. I have had no issues thus far. It has satisfied my needs very well. I use my phone for work, recreation, general internet browsing, social networking and all the normal phone functions. I added some pictures from the camera for examples.",

            "body": "Here is a great sprint story. I have been having network issues since we joined Sprint. I called last week and they walked me through how to reset our phones and to connect to the network again. While my pregnant wife is out shopping she could not make a phone call to me or receive a text from me. I called Sprint to tell them we need to leave on good terms. We will pay our last bill and that is it. After being on the phone for an hour and 2 mins I got the \"we have to give you a call back\". I didn't get a call back so I got on Sprint Chat to get some attention again. I was placed on hold 5 times before I talked to a manager, EACH TIME having to explain our situation. If my wife goes into labor and I am at work it is a very unsettling feeling that I know she probably can't get a hold of me. They want me to take my wife phone from her while she is at home to have it looked at by one of their techs. The final conclusion was \"we will have an answer for you by Monday\". MONDAY? What if she goes into labor this weekend? They keep on stating that I signed a contract to pay. Well I signed a contract to have service that I do not get. So Sprint is in void of this contract and I should be able to get out with not penalty. So far I have spent 2.5 hours on the phone today with Sprint with no resolution.",

The box I got was a Tmobile box, it even included a microSIMcard. I have had it for a week now and I am getting 4g LTE speeds and everything seems to be working very well! I am so happy about my purchase from an Amazon seller, because the price was $200 less regular price for T-mobile customers. Just make sure you ask the seller directly which version it is - there are 3 versions of Lumia 925: RM-892 (international), RM-893 (US version for Tmobile and AT&T), RM-910 (asia version with no 4G) (source: Wikipedia). I got the RM-893 and 4G LTE works great on T-Mobile.",

I figured it couldn't hurt to still post this review as a tribute to this phone for its years of loyal service. The advent of the samsung galaxy S8 is probably the first time glance screen has been adopted by another phone manufacturer and that's comforting since I genuinely cannot live without that feature on my phone. I also own the newer supposedly better lumia 930 but despite having a better camera somehow the 925 just works better for me as a daily phone. If the windows phone platform was still receiving app support and sensible updates I would honestly keep using this phone for another couple of years.",

            "body": "This phone is fantastic! I bought the Lumia 920 for my daughter for her first phone. I ended up hogging it from her! When my iPhone 4S had an issue, I quickly found the Lumia 925 and ordered it. I could not be more pleased with my overall experience with the phone. I've had it for over a week and haven't had an ounce of buyer's remorse. Pros: - Smooth interface - Customizable look and feel - Superlative camera and camera apps - Great integration with various social networks - Apps... Yes Apps. The one thing that you always hear is that Windows Phones do not have apps. They do. Everything that I had on my iPhone I now have on my Windows Phone or a something similar. - I love the high contrast background that is uniform between apps and menus. - It's different! You do not see a lot of 925's in America, so the phone stands out and makes a statement. It has a style. Cons: - Cortana is in beta, but is still awesome - The back cover is very slick, so it always feels like I'm going to drop it. I just bought a case. Problem Solved. - I did like the Home button voice dial feature on the iPhone, which the 925 does not have. It takes a few more steps to launch Cortana which makes calling tricky when driving. But Cortana has very good speech pattern recognition. I would highly recommend the Nokia Lumia 920 and 925. The 920 is built like a tank, while the 925 is more like a sports car, and I love both of them. The 920 is perfect for my daughter who, as a teenager, will be more prone to dropping it, while the 925 has a more corporate look. Attached are some picture that I have taken with the 925. I am very pleased with the purchase.",

            "body": "The switch to aluminium from what I thought was a gaudy and bulky poly carbonate plastic casing the 920 has is a huge step in the right direction. This phone is great all around. I am a big fan of windows phone so I am completely fine with the OS and its current standing with it's app limitations. The phone itself is great and the different suites of apps that nokia provides makes all the difference. I used to have the HTC 8x. That was also a great phone although the lumia 925 has the better features, better battery life, and camera quality. The only thing the HTC 8x outdid compared to the lumia 925 was sound quality via headset and/or speakers. Of course HTC has the upside of using Beats technology and built-in extra amps, but the difference in quality seems incredibly noticeable even after messing with the equalizer in settings. Overall though, great phone. I hope Microsoft continues to improve the lumia lines in the same matter as Nokia as done so far.",

            "body": "Bought this phone for my wife who was complaining about the complexity of the Android ecosystem. Really, she couldn't care less about multiple apps or widgets or rooting her phone. She just wants Facebook status updates, a decent Contacts app in a form factor that is somewhat smaller than the recent spate of monster-sized Android phones. (As an aside, personally, I use either a Galaxy Note 2 or a Galaxy S4, both rooted - she wants nothing to do with all that). This phone fit the bill perfectly. After a bit of a learning curve, she fell into a routine with this phone. Call quality is great. The keyboard is spot-on perfect for her smaller hands. She loves this phone. Well, she loves it when it works, anyway. Lately, this phone has been powering off at strange times. Sometimes it requires a soft reset to bring it back. Other times, simply plugging it into the charger is enough to bring it back to life. After a quick trip through the Googles, I'm finding that we're waiting for a specific over-the-air firmware update to resolve this problem. Thing is, that firmware update hasn't hit her phone yet. So...the waiting game. If your phone's OS is 8.0.10327.78, you are still waiting for the firmware update. Aside from this absolutely MAJOR issue with the phone's stability, its a wonderful flagship device for Windows Phone 8. Its really too bad that people don't give it a fair shake. Its not nearly as feature rich as a Droid, nor does it have as many apps as an iPhone. But there are just certain people out there who really...don't care about all that. They want the uncomplicated basics. Most of those people buy iPhones because family insists or have Androids foisted upon them by overeager Best Buy geeks. (nothing against the geeks - I am one) Those people should be looking at Windows Phone 8. And provided they get a phone that isn't firmware-broken right off the bat, I think they'll enjoy the experience.",

Please disregard marketing that focuses mainly on megapixel count. Everyone who sees pictures or videos taken with this phone comments on how impressed they are with the quality. Screen is perfect for this OS. I have my tiles on a black background and you cannot tell where the edge of the screen is because of the inky blacks. Nokia Apps set the phone apart. If you are considering a windows phone, you would be doing a disservice to yourself by buying something other than a Nokia. Nokia smart cam, job lens, creative studio, photbeamer are all examples of Nokia-made apps that I use frequently and are unique to Lumias. Cons- App selection. While Nokia has rallied to keep wp8 on pace, major apps are still coming to iPhone>android>>>maayyybe WP8. If you will not settle for a non official instagram, vine, or snapchat app you will be frustrated. 3rd party apps exist for all of the above though, so really you could stop whining IMO. The one MAJOR app that wp8 NEEDS to have would be square. WP8 is such a perfect business phone, and many of those businesses would like to be able to take payments....Myself included. I can't bring myself to take away a star for this though because thats not Nokias fault.",

However, with onedrive storage, that isn't really an issue unless you are in a location where you don't have access to it. Only other thing to watch out for is that the camera sometimes spazzes out and gives you a greenish hue, very dark screen resulting in black pictures. Restarting your phone usually fixes this, however. Very crisp screen resolution and quick response. I love the windows phone system as a student and professional who needs access to programs on the go. However, there is the limitations of apps to be aware of, which is significant. As time passes, however, more apps are being added, and I expect as the windows phone base grows, it will become more \"mainstream.\" But still, if you are a\"phone gamer\" be aware that your fave games may not be on the OS.",

            "body": "With Nokia 925 you will get a solid body with great build quality, but not the latest and greatest specs. WP 8 is a good mobile OS, but actually still needs a lot of improvement, specially when it comes to the quality and availability of apps. It looks like there are a lot of developers trying to put a lot of apps available, but with no consideration about quality and user experience. Just to give you an example, toast notifications are a privacy issue for a lot people (cannot be disable for system apps like SMS messaging), but it is in fact a parameter that can be control at programming level for a lot of other popular apps like Whatsapp and Line but it is still a missing feature. It does not have anything to do with the OS per se, but at the end it affects the overall user experience. I have read a lot of complaints about it and there are people that are actually willing to return their WP because of this, so it is important to consider. Another interest thing is that even though you are not getting the latest and greatest hardware, WP minimalist approach to user interface feels very fluid. It is not for everyone for sure, but I like it. Android will give you a lot of options to personalize your phone, but sometimes if you don't have great hardware specs, you will get lag and hurt user experience at the end. I believe that WP is not design for people who like to change and personalize their phones a lot, just to get something functional and minimalist. Do your own research and see if it matches what you expect from a smartphone. You will find good video reviews online that will help you with your decision. As far as I'm concerned, Nokia Lumia 925 is a solid phone, with a good OS, and expecting an OS upgrade in 2014 (WP 8.1) that will bring new features to get it closer to Android or iOS functionality.",

            "body": "Update: I've updated this review as of 7 April 2014 after an OS update. I was previously an Android phone user and recently decided to give the Lumia 925 a try. I don't have any complaints with the hardware as it's a really well made phone. I'm reasonably satisfied with the phone. My main issues are all related to Windows Phone OS and apps. Let me go through everything though. - Design - The phone is thin and looks really sleek. Fonts and pictures look sharp on the 768 x 1280 pixel resolution display. The display seems very close to the surface and it looks really good. Readability is good under the glaring sun. The screen is optimized for black background. When the screen is black, it blends with a black coloured phone nicely. Power button, unlike other phones, is located on the right side instead of the top, and accessible by the middle finger. You don't have to use the power button though because double tapping on the screen will wake the phone from sleep. Sound quality of the speakers is good. - Ease of use - Overall, it's a simple phone to use for calling and messaging. If your contacts are stored with Google, you'll be able to download them and store them in the phone. User interface is generally snappy. Applications open fast, and if they are slow it's because of the app design (i.e. Skype). - Camera - The camera is about 28mm wide, f2, 8MP with OIS. So it's a relatively capable for taking photos in low light. Looking at comparison photos online, the image quality seems as good or better than other brands, but as with camera phones, they all have that digital feel to them. There's a dedicated physical camera button at the bottom right side for launching the camera app and taking photos. Very convenient. You can also half-press that button to focus, and full press to shoot. If you're getting a case, get one that does not cover the camera button as you'll want to feel the half press. The issue with the camera is that it's quite slow to have the camera app launched and running. This is not a camera phone where you can shoot quickly whenever you see a picture moment, but there aren't a lot of camera phones that can do that anyway. - Apps - Availability of applications is the biggest issue to note when you're switching from other OS. Windows Phones has a smaller library compared to Android and iOS. If you need certain critical applications, you will want to research to see if there's an alternative here. For me, I just use Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Skype and a couple of photography apps. For photography apps, definitely go and download Nokia Pro Cam which gives you all the manual functions to the camera. The inbuilt music player isn't terrific but works. If you've iTunes, you have to install the Nokia software to be able to import your playlists. Search is via the inbuilt Bing search button. There's a Google Seach app available. - File storage and transfers - I'm using the Lumia on a Mac. There are Nokia softwares for photos and document transfers. As far as copying (drag and dropping) a file from the desktop to phone via the USB cable, I still cannot find any good app for that. Come on, sometimes I just want to put a Photoshop file on the phone and work on it further at home, but I can't with this phone. With iOS, you can install the many file manager apps. With Android, it's plug and play. With Windows Phone, I've nothing to say. We all work with files so there really is no reason to not have such basic functionality. For files that the phone support, e.g. photos and video that the phone takes, you can install the Nokia Windows Phone software on your computer (I'm using Mac) and you can select the files to download or upload. It's a very simple software, I wished there are ways to create folders. - Email - You can set up Gmail with the phone. However, you won't get all the Gmail features like search, archive, etc. There's an unoffcial Gmail app available for download. Windows Phone syncs Gmail every 15 minutes, but syncs their Microsoft mail instantly. This could be an issue for those who use email a lot for work, and require close to instantaneous response. - Quirks - The status bar shows only the time. You have to tap it once to show battery life, internet and phone connection. There's no (aesthetic) reason why it should not show all the statuses. With most applications, if you scroll down too far, it's not easy to scroll back up. In other phones, you typically tap the top status bar to scroll up automatically. The most irritating thing of all is the phone is not smart enough to know the orientation of photos and videos taken. There are times when I take photos with the Nokia Pro Camera app in landscape mode, the photo when viewed (phone held vertically) is upside down. Sometimes, videos taken in landscape mode, when downloaded appear in vertical mode. There's no easy way to tell the orientation that is being recorded -- just because you're shooting in landscape does not mean you're recording in landscape. If there's a good reason not to buy this phone, it's this one. There also needs to be some way to show clearly (upload bar) whenever a photo or video is being uploaded to Microsoft Skydrive. All these quirks are usability quirks that can be fixed via firmware upgrades if there are any. Microsoft has already fixed quite a few quirks since the last time I wrote this review in September 2013. - Conclusion - As I've mentioned, the hardware is great but Windows Phones as an OS certainly has a lot of room for improvement. Minor tweaks really. If you're on a budget, I would suggest Google Nexus 4. I would have gone that route if that phone can be sold and shipped to my country Singapore. Personally, I prefer Android running on phones. There are some who say it's not as user-friendly, but hey, the learning curve is extremely gentle. Price is the real consideration. I've seen phones with rather similar specifications selling for less than half the price. The premium you pay for a brand oftentimes does not translate to a significantly smarter phone. I've been using the phone for a few months now. There are no terrible crashes. It's generally smooth sailing. Battery life could be better. How much time you can get out of the battery can be erratic. You'll have to charge daily that's for sure. Hardware - 5 out of 5 stars. Windows Phone OS - 4 out of 5 stars.",

Battery life needs watching and a few of the regaular apps like Trains have a bit of catching up to do. But apart from that, everything feels like as good or better than the iPhone. This will do very nicely.",

Phone works and came with a charger, headphones, light duty case (for free), and a screen protector (for free) that was already attached to the phone. The only issue is the phone came in the incorrect packaging for the Lumia 925 and had the instruction manual for the 925. The manual was in Chinese and I most likely damaged the top speaker trying to open the SIM card slot. The 925 uses a key/pin to open the SIM card slot, the 928 does not. To open the SIM card slot, with a fingernail firmly pull the slot up and out of the phone. The small tray comes out and the micro SIM card is placed in the tray, and the slot and card are reinserted into the phone.",

Kind of a rip off when considering you're stuck with verizon, the most expensive network out there.

I simply have too say; I started at 8:30am at 100% and it is currently 7:51pm on February 5th when I'm doing this review and I have 56% left, with close to 4hrs ost(on-screen-time)with some web browsing, listening to music, lots of texting, no games, no videos, brightness at about 20%. The performance is above average, at 3 yrs old still in 2018 this thing is a BEAST going strong with lots of fluidity and no lags once so ever!!! Apps open up quick with ease. Build quality is study, but when you turn it over there when u discover heaven. Has a very unique design that feels good in the hands made from a fabric called \"ballistic nylon supposed to be very strong and sturdy and so far it's stands by its claim. A 21 mp camera that takes decent pictures in good light, not recommended in low light but if you can get the updates up and going that should take care of the cameras software. Very good camera nonetheless. Here are some ratings that hopefully help you guys out to buy this phone \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 PERFORMANCE: 9.5/10 BATTERY:10/10\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d(almost 2 days on a single charge) BUILD:8/10(great feel) CAMERA: 8.5/10 (21mp)",

            "body": "May be refurbished on the outside but the battery is clearly not. It consistently shuts off at 20% battery, without warning. It also drains battery much faster than my previous phone (same make and model) did when it was brand new under materially the same conditions. I didn't get my phone info transferred over right away due to problems with Verizons transfer software so I am now outside the return window. I wouldn't recommend others get this phone as I would (I think reasonably) expect that the battery be replaced as part of the refurbishment - and from what I can tell in my experience it wasn't.",

I was looking for a sharp camera, with excellent call reception. Well, a slight learning curve on the phone, as it did not come with instructions. However, I am not impressed with the camera. I was expecting much sharper, clearer pics, at least comparable to my galaxy. They are not. And the phone also doesn't have swipe for screenshot capability that I have gotten used to. So I'm disappointed in the camera end. The calls were doing fine until yesterday, and now people are telling me that I sound muffled. I am currently working on resolving that problem, and hoping that it does get resolved.",

            "body": "Comparing this with the Samsung S4, the screen tend to be dimmer. But I bought this because of the battery life, and the Turbo charging. The turbo charging is amazing! It charged so fast, and it lasts forever. What does a bright and nice screen matter, if you spend half of day charging it? I like the Kevlar backed, \"bullet proof\" back, and I even like the heaviness of the phone from the weight of the battery. I like the fact that the back button is on the left side instead of right like in Samsung. This is the clean version of Google Android operation, but there are still Apps that you can't delete, especially Amazon vs Amazon Shopping, which is very confusing, because I can't seem to update the Amazon app that came with the phone. This reminds me of the original Nexus phone that I had. I loved that phone, and I love this phone. Let me get back on the battery life. If you're conscious about deleting the process often, then this can last two days easy. Even if it's at 15%, it lasts few hours. And the best part is, the high voltage Turbo Charging, which charges this badboy in no time. But beware, if you use that Turbo Charging charger on anything else than your phone, it might blow the battery out on it.",

I wouldn't have an issue with this and would not mention it if it were a simple matter of unclipping a battery and swapping. The Turbo's battery, unfortunately, is not an easy task to replace for the untalented type. But I got it done and I'm back to enjoying the battery life that the phone is known for.

The phone is also still very fast (I have a OnePlus 3t to compare it against). The icing one the cake is definitely the Moto actions. All in all, still very good for a few more years or as a backup phone. 4.5/5 stars! Update: Had to return due to mentioned sunken power button becoming stuck and unresponsive on one side. The capacitive back button also became unresponsive and only usable after a factory reset - which I've had to do 3x already due to said issue. Will order another one and will update. Update 3/9/18: Received and set up new one. All seemed well but the capacitive buttons are not responding well to tempered glass (even the 0.2 thickness).",

            "body": "The best smartphone I have owned to date. Powerful fast, and has a great screen. The camera is very good, in poor lighting it is just average though. As most reviewers note, the camera software is pretty much bare-bones, that surprises me and also the fact that they have not listened and updated it. The battery life is one to one and a half days. Calls are nice and clear on both ends, the speakerphone is good, not the best but pretty good. WIFI is very good on this same with Bluetooth. The turbo charger sure is fast, wireless charging (using a cheapo generic Q1 plate) is very good. A newer version is available which means this one is available for a song, I paid less than $200 for mine and it is well worth the money. A great buy, I certainly recommend.",

            "body": "This WAS a great phone -- right up until Motorola pushed a forced system update that completely disabled the phone's ability to both talk on the phone and use the Internet simultaneously. I went to Verizon Wireless store to get it fixed and they said it was irreversible on their end, and that the update was rolled out by Motorola. They knew exactly what happened, acknowledged that it wasn't cool, and I've been stuck with a phone that I can't talk + surf or use apps at the same time ever since. That was about 5-6 months ago. I can't even use my Waze GPS app while talking on the phone anymore! Nor can I send or receive texts if I'm on the phone. This is ridiculous. Motorola should be sued for making these original DROID Turbo's defunct to force you to buy a DROID 2 with no apparent way to reverse the update. I was 100% happy with this phone until Motorola forced this update. Well, to heck with them. I'm not buying another Motorola product ever again as I can't trust that they won't do something like this to a future phone to ruin a major portion of its functionality to force me to upgrade again. Mind you, I'm on a Verizon Wireless prepaid plan. This may play a role in this, but it shouldn't. I pay $45 per month for unlimited talk and text and should have every ability to use my phone just like contracted VZW customers. Anyway, shame on you Motorola. You need to at least offer a software roll-back option to customers whose phones you RUINED.",

Very recommended to anyone looking for a great phone for a kids of just for yourself that wont break the bank. Will buy again if ever needed. The only Con I have about this product is that it never came with the OEM charger but it worked tell I ordered a OEM on off of eBay 2 years later. Very fast shipping to, Came earlier that what the estimated time was. Thanks for selling me this phone. -1/1/2018",

I don't know if its the phone itself because I didn't buy it from Verizon brand new or it its the fact that its a refurbished phone but what I hear from everyone is that its supposed to have great battery life which it does not have. I honestly can say that I would not buy another phone from this seller or any other online phone seller again.",

It has the volume up, but does not ring and does not even show missed calls on the call log. I've tried changing ring tones, contacted verizon for assistance and still only rings occasionally. I have had full service during these times. The phone has often been laying on the same table when it wouldn't ring and when it did. I have tried 2 new SIM cards in it (both from Verizon), tried adjusting settings, etc. It is quite inconvenient since I have to check my voice frequently and HOPE if anyone wanted something important they left a message, although some people have told me a few times they didn't even get my voicemail. For this reason I wouldn't recommend it.",

A week later I received another (refurbished) phone. 3 months later it stopped connecting to the network. Received my third phone (also refurbished) and the wifi never worked well, the GPS was never very accurate and using the calibration tool NEVER worked. This phone was often slow and unresponsive. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",

I literally am at my wit's end about how to manage my phone on a day to day basis. A full charge of battery lasts only 5-6 hours! I once finished charging my phone at 12 AM before going to sleep and when I woke up at 7, it was dead! No screen usage whatsoever. I have, over the last month, deleted pretty much every widget on the phone hoping for an improvement but with no luck. I used to trust products that I buy off Amazon, but I am not sure anymore. It is incumbent on the seller to inform a customer that shells out over $200 for a product that the battery life is not just sub-optimal, but horrifically so.",

            "body": "4.5 stars. Phone is everything I expected it to be. I typically spend six months or more researching my next device that I will hold onto for 2+ years. After being tired of the design-flawed Touchwiz Samsung UI, I decided to return home to the mostly Android stock experience and Motorola's light UI overlay; not to mention their superior cell and GPS radios. Plus, Verizon really goes all out for it's own Droid carrier specific devices. Being a grandfathered unlimited data slave to Verizon, I wanted the best offered at the best price. I was initially apprehensive about the capacitive buttons but hearing stories about on-screen button 'burn in' with the Nexus 6 and Moto X 2014, that is certainly not a bad thing and has been nicely done with no real feel of 'dated-ness'. Everything negative you have heard about this phone is most likely 'sour grapes' from someone on a different carrier. However, there is good news. This phone is GSM unlocked (thanks FCC) and therefore you can use it with other GSM carriers such as T-Mobile or AT&T by simply popping in their respective SIM cards. However, the one catch to that may be not all 4G LTE that other GSM carriers use may be supported by a strictly Verizon exclusive device. This also goes for international GSM 4G LTE carriers if you use the phone outside of the United States. The only negative that is of any consequence to me as a power user is the front-facing yet inadequate speaker for phone calls. In order to hear anyone on a phone call I either have to press my face up smugly against the phone (which I hate) or turn on speaker-phone, which at times can be inappropriate. No phone will ever check all an individuals user specific boxes, but being actual talking on the phone is becoming less and less a preference for many (myself included) this phone is the best Android device available at the moment. Pros: -Huge 3900 MAH Battery (I get no less than 18 hours with ultra-heavy use). -Motorola Turbo Charger (2%-3% To 100% in no time) -Beautiful but not over-saturated Quad HD Display. -Almost stock Android experience with enjoyable Motorola UI compliments. -You can disable or remove most of the un-wanted bloatware. -Now has calling and simultaneous data update! -The Camera is the best ever to be in any Motorola phone, including the Nexus 6 and Moto X 2014. -Rugid, masculine, ballistic nylon design (looks great and feels great in the hand!-first phone I've ever used without any case or screen protector! I recommend everyone see how great it really looks and feels before deciding to purchase or not). -No obnoxious Verizon branding. -Great deal $$$ for new or re-newing Verizon customers considering top of the line specs. Cons: -No removable SD card storage (64 GB version negates this slightly; removable storage becoming less of the norm overall). -Ear phone speaker is inadequate unless using the speaker phone. Meh: -Still waiting for Android 5.0 Lollipop.",

            "body": "Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser. \u00a0I've been waiting to upgrade my aging galaxy nexus. i tried the LG-G3, and it was just too darn wide and had an issue with the microphone. Come black friday, i was able to get this on an upgrade, with the 100 off special, and another 100 off for trading in an old smartphone. price out the door? $6.99 for a superphone Note about many negative reviews i've seen around: When released, the turbo couldn't do talk & data at the same time. tThis feature has been added in firmware, so if you're concerned about the less than perfect rating on sites like verizon, dig around & you'll find many are now irrelevant. -Fast, really fast processor handles tasks quickly -Screen is gorgeous, it's been a month and i'm still enjoying looking at it -Battery life is very good, not brilliant, but very good -Speed charging is pretty darn great when you realize you forgot to charge it and need to run. -Moto UI is pretty faithful to stock, and anything extra i haven't minded -The camera is very good, i only wish it had optical stabilization like the G3 -4k video looks very good, there are apps to control finer settings like bitrate. (open camera, FV-5) -Splash resistance is good to know Cons? -Really wish 5+inch screens weren't the new norm, i feel the 4.7-4.9\" were ideal, larger than that = not really ideal for single hand use. -No card port -No removable battery -Doesn't make bacon pancakes. -Wife cracked her phone's screen and is a year+ from upgrade time and gives dirty looks. -Not waterproof like the competition All in all, i've really been enjoying it, and feel it's a very solid phone. I went for the red, which is not typical of me, but i said hey, i kinda want some color. and figured i'd be putting it in a case anyways. Vs G3, S5, etc.. I tried the G3 for a week, and it just felt too wide. I also had a bad mic it seemed, as many callers couldn't hear me well. The s5 is like the standard, and while it had the features i was looking for, i was turned off by the incredibly cheap/chintzy chromed edge it has. Yea i know, not a huge deal, but i just didn't feel connection with the s5, i'm weird that way. Probably also didn't like that EVERYONE and their aunt has one. I didn't bother with many of the other phones because they didn't offer 4k video, which is a feature i demanded. I have good reason: I'm a videographer, and i do stock footage, so when i don't have a camera with me, and i spot something, my phone is the only thing to use. I think this phone won't sell like crazy because of the early negative reviews that slammed it on not having talk/data at the same time, which is something that's now included. That's something i'll like about it, that it's not a friggin iphone that everyone's got.",

            "body": "This is a high-end smartphone packed with some serious hardware. Before I get to that, I am a Droid fan and my last few phones have been by Motorola. My house is split as there is a big Apple fan. I\u2019m also very impressed with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line. In sum, I appreciate other companies and phones, but I feel the Droid Turbo by Motorola will launch into popularity. What would drive you to this? For me, it was the multitude of features, but the battery (3800MaH) is a big one. No, talking about batteries isn\u2019t sexy, but with the turbo charging, it only takes 15 minutes (yes, you are reading that right) to get around eight hours of life. Admit it \u2013 that is pretty sexy. There is a reason there is a huge aftermarket for battery cases, chargers and gizmos, after all. I went with RAZR over iPhone two years ago and a big driver was the battery life. Motorola has made it a no brainer for this new two-year commitment. The last I\u2019ll go into detail is the screen (Gorilla 3, AMOLED). It is a great size but is smaller than the iPhone 6+ and Galaxy Note 4. It is impressive; 565 PPI with 16 million colors. Bright, crisp \u2013 great for zoom-ins, games and media; even checking work email here and there, which I discourage. Other highlights are the 21MP camera with dual LED flash (4K video capture) and user facing 2MP capable of 1080p video capture. It comes loaded with KitKat and the 2.7GHz processor with 3GB RAM can handle pretty much anything you through at it. Lastly, it has a nice menu features for the camera, but if you are a heavy, heavy \u2018phonetog\u2019, the Galaxy may be your thing. AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) in case you were itching to know",

This is my first Motorola Android phone and I'm really impressive with their software. I love stock Android and think all their additions on top are actually super helpful. Pros: Specs on par with Nexus 6. The size is perfect and can be used 1-handed. Really fast and smooth experience everywhere. Basically stock Android with actual improvements added. Very capable battery. Trubo charging is pretty handy. Decent camera. The price is right. Water resistant. Cons: Body has a plasticy feel compared to other flagship phones. Nylon on the back is fine, but looks like it will fray over time. Camera is slow to take, which will hopefully be fixed with an update. No Lollipop update yet. Lots of Verizon bloatware pre-installed, but it's easy enough to unintall/disable all those in <10min. Other notes: the capacitive buttons (vs on screen) don't bug me at all. They work just fine.",

            "body": "TL;DR - Pretty standard phone - Great battery with really great charging feature - Slow at times with certain applications and bad call quality. I highly suggest the LG G4 over this (only reason I didnt get it was because I got this for free) This is a pretty basic phone for whats out there today. I had the LG G2 which I feel was just as fast, if not faster than this phone. It even held a charge just as well as the Turbo. The one thing that sets this phone aside is the Turbo Charge. Its truly amazing how fast it charges up (although I do feel that will kill the battery quicker as batteries can only hold so many charges) The notifications are really cool. If you get a text, you can just swipe your screen to dismiss it. You can also hold down on the icon to see a preview of the text. Another feature thats actually really handy is when you go to reach for your phone, it lights up. Super handy. So instead of pressing the power button to see if you have messages, you just wave your hand in front of it to turn the screen on. Pros: Turbo Charger Pretty decent Speaker Phone 3GB RAM Notfications are handy Decent Display Texting app work very well with lots of great features Cons: Battery can run upwards of 110 Degrees Fahrenheit Processing speed doesn't seem that fast at times Camera seems OK but not great (Snapchat videos seem to come out choppy - could be the application and not the phone) Autobrightness really does not work well The call quality really stinks - volumes not loud at all",

            "title_review": "Brains, Brawn and Beauty.... what more can you ask for in a phone.",
            "body": "this is without a doubt a great phone. I was upgrading from the droid razr maxx hd and ordered this from Amazon way back when but it wasn't in stock. I waited and waited and waited and finally, with my old phone misbehaving and taking forever to complete the simplest tasks, I couldn't wait any longer so I unfortunately had to purchase it from verizon. I far far far prefer getting my cell phones from Amazon... they have a much more lenient exchange policy. I just trust them to do the right thing. Not always the case with certain verizon stores. And, though the following statement has nothing to do with this phone and really needn't be in this review, I just have to say that when I purchased this phone from a local verizon kiosk I had the single worst cell phone buying experience ever. Too Bad. Now on to the positives about the phone.... - this thing is very responsive. You touch an app and it opens. It doesn't take its sweet time thinking about whether or not it wants to open. Everything is snappy. - flick your wrist twice to start the camera.... this is brilliant. Now when you see a photo you want to take you don't have to fumble for the camera app. Just flick your phone twice and the camera is on. Kind of like dorothy clicking her heals to get back home - Battery life. Maybe, just maybe it doesn't get a full 48 hours on one charge, but this thing IS a monster. It goes on and on and on and on and on. Really impressive battery life - quick charge.... using the rapid charger really does make a difference and is IS rapid - wireless charging capability. You've got to love being able to induction charge your phone. When I am at work I just lay it on the QI charger and don't think about it - beautiful. this shouldn't matter, but somehow it does. This thing in red is just spectacular - easy user interface. - moto voice commands work incredibly well. I was startled the first time I was in the car alone and a voice boomed out telling me I had a text and moto voice was asking if I wanted it to be read to me. Then it asked me if I wanted to respond to my texter. And it got everything right. Much more advanced voice recognition than my last phone. I had a ten minute texting dialog with a friend while driving and never once did I remove the phone from my pocket. I never looked at it at all. I am very anti texting and driving so the ability to do it without touching the phone is pretty amazing to me. - the screen is gorgeous. Photos and videos just pop. I was afraid I would find this too large to hold but it's okay. It is pretty much the outer limit of the size I want my phone to be but it is manageable with one hand most of the time. And now for my quibbles.... - no micro sd card slot - the stock email app does not have a \"select all\" option in order to batch delete older emails. You can't even batch delete from the trash. I installed a third party email app (Blue Mail, which is fantastic) - as far as I can tell, the camera does not have an exposure compensation setting. I hate using flash but I will have to if they don't do a software update for this. - as of this the writing of this review I am not sure they have done a software update so that you can use voice and data at the same time. When I am on the phone and try to schedule an appointment, I always receive the message that data isn't available while on the phone. I thought they were supposed to have this fixed by the end of 2014? This is fairly basic technology these days. Despite a few minor enough quibbles this phone is an absolute pleasure. I am sure when I am nearing the end of my contract in a couple of years I will find it maddening. For now I would go out on a limb and say it is one of the best phones on the market today, if not THE best. But that's just my humble opinion. You may disagree. BOTTOM LINE: HIGHLY recommend this phone",

            "body": "I bought this to replace my Samsung GS 4. I had had the Droid RAZR before and really liked it, and didn't fall for the GS4 all that much. There is no perfect phone and the Turbo isn't it, either. That said, I am not pining for my GS4. I love the Turbo's screen and long battery life. Haven't gotten 48 hours from the battery as advertised, but I haven't tried, either. I know the power lasts a whole longer than it did on the Samsung, which sucked the battery dry in well under a day. The Droid's \"turbo\" charger works as advertised and will really pump up battery charge in a short time. It is, btw, just a 15-watt charger so any other 15W charger will do the same. I have read that all smartphones will move to this. About the upgrade to Lollipop 5.1: My phone came with v. 4.4.4 and the upgrade directly to 5.1 was released about a week ago. It did not go well for mine. The screen advised it would take 20 minutes. I had upgraded the Samsung to 5.0 so I thought I knew what to expect. Once the upgrade started I plugged in the charger and walked away. TWO HOURS later all the phone was doing was to cycle through boot, then \"installing update,\" then to the dead phone symbol of the little Android robot lying on its back. Over and over. I called Verizon tech support, who called Motorola, who said they had never encountered that before. Verizon is overnighting me a replacement Turbo as I type, but since the happened Friday night, overnight means I'll get it Tuesday. The phone would not factory reset, either, nor would it turn off. So I figured the battery would run down overnight and I left it on my desk when I went to watch the ball game on TV. Three hours later I came back and -- the phone was fully updated and fully functional with no data or apps lost. It actually conserves battery power even better than before. I have no idea what the problem was, but the update was successful after all, it just took five hours instead of 20 minutes. So I am keeping it.",

            "body": "This is a great phone! I just moved up from a Droid RAZR M a little over a week ago. I wanted a phone with a bigger screen, better photo capability and larger internal memory than the RAZR. And I have not been disappointed at all! I can read much easier on the big screen. Since the phone is larger than the RAZR, I have to get accustomed to using my fingers a little differently to Swype, but I'm learning quickly. The photos are excellent, and the phone automatically reads any text that's within the photo (like the name on the side of a truck), turns it into text, and adds it to the file description of the photo. The 64 GB of memory is incredible! I had run out of space for apps on my old phone (only 8 GB). When I got the Turbo, I loaded it with all the apps I wanted, and I've still only used about 5% of the available memory. I don't need an SD card, because all my documents, music and photos are on OneDrive. And I wasn't particularly looking for more battery charging capability. I have chargers in my house, purse and car because I was always charging the RAZR M. (If I wasn't retired, I'd have a charger at work, too.) But I have noticed that I'm charging the Turbo less than the old phone. Some people have complained about low volume on Turbo calls. I have found that my phone has much better volume and sound quality than my old phone. My husband is hard of hearing and I always had to use my speakerphone when I called him, but no more! He can hear me very clearly with the normal phone volume. And it's plenty loud and clear for me, too. I recommend this phone very highly to anyone who is looking for a new smartphone.",

            "body": "I don't usually write reviews, but I can't even believe that my Droid turbo is still working. It has been completely submerged in water THREE times, been splashed and spilled on, I have dropped it too many times to count. It has dents on all four corners and a few spots in between, even a couple of cracks in the screen. The cracks are only visible if I turn the brightness all the way up on my phone and then it just looks like a thin black line. Anyhow, it don't even make sense. I dropped it in the bathtub, once in January and again in March. I was so surprised that it still worked after the second time, I've been trying to be extra careful with it (well, actually, it's been through all this with out a case so I probably should be careful enough to put one on it, but at this point, I really just don't want to jinx myself by changing it up). Saturday, it rained all day. I was out visiting and dropped my phone next to my van in a little puddle for 30 minutes before I realized that it was missing and it was raining on it the entire time! I was afraid to even look at it and kept expecting it to just stop working from the water damage for hours. It worked all day Sunday with no issues. And then, I am not kidding you, my son was in the bath and I had to go to work. I leaned over to kiss him and my phone fell out of my hoodie pocket and into the bathtub. I kept wiping at it and shaking it all the way to work, Held it under one of those super max hand dryers for a few minutes and it never even turned off. For about 8 hours, the volume would activate on the screen. I've had no problems with it most of the day yesterday and not at all today. I might get another phone in 8 months when it's paid off, but I'm not trading it in, and I'll be getting the newer droid turbo 2. I'm not even going to shop around for a different model, that's how sold I am...",

            "body": "cell phones, over the last decade or so, have become a necessity, something you have to have all day everyday. My old iphone 4 8gb, was on it's last legs. freezing up and battery wouldn't last more than 3 hours without a charge. i had been eyeing the motorola droid turbo since it came out, and decided to go ahead and upgrade. phone comes in a very nice, sleek box, naturally, there is VERY LITTLE information that comes with the phone. that's why you have to come online to youtube and other sites to figure out how to operate the phone. phone comes with a turbo charger and a very SHORT cord. so plan, on buying a new cord or a extension. the phone can charge to full charge in less than an hour. the phone has a massive 3,900 MH battery. that translates to a lot of use. i have had upwards of 30 hours on a charge and still had 45 percent left! however, your battery life is going to depend on a lot of things, screen brightness, apps and other things running. i have had this phone for about a month, and my battery life has stayed pretty steady. i keep the screen brightness down, and keep the gps on battery saving mode and my results have been great. phone display is a beautiful AMOLED display. i paired mine with a\u00a0Otterbox Otterbox 77-50191 Droid(tm) Turbo By Motorola(r) Commuter Series(r) Case (scarlet Flash) - Carrying Case - Retail Packaging - Scarlet Flash\u00a0and am very happy. I never have a phone without a case. the droid operating system is easy to use, but if your coming from a iphone, there is a learning curve. just be mindful of that if your a former iphone user. im very happy with this phone, if your tired of the slowness of the iphone etc, get a droid turbo today! update 1/17/16** phone performed flawlessly UNTIL the android lollipop update. now battery life is NO WHERE near as good as it was. i love android, but i really do wish phone manufacturers would test the updates more with various phones/models before they push the update to everyone. now i can't even make it through a full day on a charge :( ugh!",

            "body": "So I just got this phone about two days ago, and so far it's is pretty awesome. I had this phone brought to India because it is a few hundred dollars cheaper than it is here, and it works perfectly. So if you are wondering if it will work in you country just make sure it has your band which it probably does and it will work. One this is I had to set up and account number when I bought it but as long as you don't activate the sin card you can just put in your own and use it. Pros -awesome screen. I mean it's freaking 2k it's just as just as good as you would think it is. There isn't a super huge difference between this and a 1080p screen but it's just a great screen. Also brightness levels are fine and it works pretty well outdoors, I do wish sometimes that it would go darker but this isn't a big deal and is easily fixed with and app. -build. People say that this phone is fat, and comparatively yes it is. But when you are actually holding it in your hand it doesn't feel fat at all it feels great. Also I really like the design and the Kevlar fabricy stuff. It is also very sturdy and doesn't feel like it will break any time soon -preformance. I am a pretty heavy user will be downloading multiple things and playing graphic intense game at the same time and this phone doesn't even stutter. I can do just about anything and this phone will fly through it all -battery. So as I said I'm a very heavy user so so far I've been seeing about 12 hours of battery life. Which doesn't sound very good but let me out this into perspective I was literally downloading apps while playing games for like five hours strait during that time so if you use it less intensively I can imagine you getting around. One and a half to two days on this thing with anywhere of 5-10 hours of on screen time. -stock android. Yes it's not lollipop but at least its not touchwiz so in happy. This things software flies and the moto feature can be helpful sometimes. And as long as it does eventually get lollipop I am happy -unlocked. Yes you can only buy it with Verizon but the actually ship this phone unlocked so can use it with any carrier or in any country. And yes you can't get it on a contract but I prefer to buy them unlocked at the full price anyway so it doesn't really effect me Cons - I have been noticing this phone heat up at times and even though it hasn't been a problem for me I Dont now what could happen in the future. -camera. the camera isn't the best but it is still plenty good it just doesn't live up to the 20 megapixel tag. It could be fixed by software updates in the future thought because the not so great pictures are just because of mediocre image processing. So overall this is an awesome phone the battery, screen and processor are undeniably awesome and I also like the software and design though that is more subjective. The few problems I identified, camera and heating up, Dont really affect me because I don't take many pictures and it doesn't get to hot so you can't use it. So it's a near perfect phone with problems that could easily get fixed with software updates that should be coming. My advice, get it",

            "body": "You may want to hold this in person and compare with the ballistic nylon version as it will be up to user preference. This is a high-end smartphone packed with some serious hardware. Before I get to that, I am a Droid fan and my last few phones have been by Motorola. My house is split as there is a big Apple fan. I\u2019m also very impressed with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line. In sum, I appreciate other companies and phones, but I feel the Droid Turbo by Motorola will launch into popularity. What would drive you to this? For me, it was the multitude of features, but the battery (3800MaH) is a big one. No, talking about batteries isn\u2019t sexy, but with the turbo charging, it only takes 15 minutes (yes, you are reading that right) to get around eight hours of life. Admit it \u2013 that is pretty sexy. There is a reason there is a huge aftermarket for battery cases, chargers and gizmos, after all. I went with RAZR over iPhone two years ago and a big driver was the battery life. Motorola has made it a no brainer for this new two-year commitment. The last I\u2019ll go into detail is the screen (Gorilla 3, AMOLED). It is a great size but is smaller than the iPhone 6+ and Galaxy Note 4. It is impressive; 565 PPI with 16 million colors. Bright, crisp \u2013 great for zoom-ins, games and media; even checking work email here and there, which I discourage. Other highlights are the 21MP camera with dual LED flash (4K video capture) and user facing 2MP capable of 1080p video capture. It comes loaded with KitKat and the 2.7GHz processor with 3GB RAM can handle pretty much anything you through at it. Lastly, it has a nice menu features for the camera, but if you are a heavy, heavy \u2018phonetog\u2019, the Galaxy may be your thing.

            "body": "Pros: Excellent Battery Life - This is the first phone I've owned that easily lasts a day. Charges quickly using the included Turbo charger, charges normally on standard microUSB chargers. Fast and Responsive - No lag, apps install in a split second. Voice Activation - The phone has a dedicated speech recognition chip which works quite well for voice commands. It automatically detects when driving in vehicle and offers to read text messages out loud, a very convenient feature. Excellent Display - The extreme high resolution of this display is overkill, if anything. Solid Build Quality - Very solid frame with no flex. My past experience with Motorola devices is that they've been very well built and durable, no reason to believe this one will be an exception. Good Product Support - Motorola offers one free, no-deductable screen replacement and has a reputation for good support. Cons: No simultaneous voice and data - Currently the cellular internet cuts out completely whenever a voice call is in progress. This would have been a dealbeaker for me, but supposedly be fixed by the end of the year once Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is enabled by Verizon. No root - Not applicable for most users, but for those who want full control of their phone, there is currently no ability to \"root\" this device and it's questionable whether it will be possible. Form factor - The size and weight doesn't bother me, but if you're looking for the thinnest, sleekest smartphone, this is definitely not it. Other: Voice quality is on par with every other recent Verizon smartphone I've used. Camera quality is fine for my purposes as a casual user, although there are probably better ones out there. Background: I've had the phone for three weeks, owned about six Android phones, including three other Motorolas, an HTC, and a Samsung. The Droid Turbo replaced a Galaxy S4 which developed an internal screen crack after 6 months. It turns out this is a common defect which Samsung refuses to acknowledge (prefer to blame customer), and despite repeated attempts they absolutely refused to honor the warranty for the device. I would have considered a Galaxy Note or S5 but will never buy another Samsung product again after experiencing their extremely poor customer support. I cross shopped against the LG G3 and preferred the feel of the Turbo and the Motorola software. Nexus 6 would have been a strong contender but was not available yet at time of purchase.",

Can manage with a Bluetooth. Otherwise phone is excellent",

            "body": "Honestly the worst phone I have ever had. I have been a die hard Droid user since the beginning and this phone is just horrible. I have always had a Droid Motorola phone, but this phone does not live up to its standards. The battery never charges and when I try to type something it often glitches. I bought my phone through my cell phone carrier and have already had to replace it twice in the past four months. Both of my replacement phones had the same issue with not being able to charge/hold a charge. At first I blamed it on the phone, then I blamed it on the charger, I even started to question if I had a short in the outlet I use in my house, but after trying my phone on different chargers and in different rooms through out my house, I realized it is a glitch in the phone. I bought this phone because it is supposed to hold a charge and charge super fast, but neither of those things happen. I go to bed some nights with 50% battery life, plug my phone in to charge, and wake up the next morning with 38% battery life. How in the world does a phone lose battery when it is plugged in to the charger and says that it is charging? Outside of the charging issue, this phone also has a tendency to shut off randomly. It has turned off on me during phone calls, in the middle of playing games, and in the middle of the night when I am not even near it.. Often times when it shuts off by itself, it refuses to turn back on for an hour or more. I would not recommend a Droid Turbo to anyone. It is too much of a hassle to deal with and it is completely unreliable.",

Now I can go most of a second day if need be. The camera is the big downside. 21 megapixels is just a scam to make you need more data, because the lens quality is small and poor. It takes passable social media shots but not comparable to the galaxy or iPhone quality, and don't bother to zoom. Any zoom instantly degrades the image. I switched to another camera app that allows you to choose lower photo default to save on storage and data. Otherwise I love it. I can't bear to put it in a case as its the perfect for factor and cloth back feels great. Not slippery at all. Sometimes turns off if in a pocket when sitting on a stool, but bright, beautiful, and fast. The other big downfall is the external speaker. Terrible sound quality.

Playing games drains the battery so fast, that I feel like I am using my 2 year old Razr again. Is my phone a dud? Am I doing something wrong? Some settings that I have not enabled/disabled?

            "body": "I will make it very simple - DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! It has known issues. Known by Motorola, known by Verizon. Neither is interested in standing behind it and making it right for the MANY of us who are being affected by this defect. SO what is the defect? Well i have a bright green vertical pixel lines that goes from top to bottom of my entire screen. Google \"Motorola Turbo2 green line\" and see for yourself, or go to their own forums to look at all the threads about people like me having an issue. Mine started off as a line 1 pixel wide, its steadily creeping wider and wider. Now i cant read entire words on it. I had the phone less than 3 months before it appeared. Have taken good care of it. No bad falls or drops. After reading the forums and how many were already on their 3rd or 4th return, and all developing the line, I had held off hoping Motorola would admit there was an issue or find a fix for it. Nope! they insist the green line is being caused by ppl dropping their phones and abusing them. The Turbo 2 is \"shatterproof, not shockproof\" to quote what they are saying about the issue. This is my third Motorola Droid style phone. I had a Droid before they had snazzy names, a Droid Razr, Droid Max and now the Droid Turbo2. The 1st 3 phones were rugged, loved them. I swore by Motorola.... up until now. But truth is, their new \"shatterproof phone\" is JUNK. I noticed early on, if i tucked the phone into a jeans pocket and didnt remove it before getting into the car , the slight bit of pressure on the phone getting in and out makes the phone entirely reboot. Before this, other than shift the phone around into a more comfortable spot in my pocket, i would be fine getting in and out a car, riding around with the other 3. This one is extremely sensitive to any pressure whatsoever. There are pressure points in different places around the screen i can press with a finger and it affects the phone. And I am not talking extreme pressure by an means. So now, that its getting difficult to read my emails I am finally returning it. No easy task. They wouldn't even allow me to go through the repair process until I send in a picture of the green lines to prove i was really having the issue. Which i would not have had a problem with if it meant it fell under a defect category and helped me get through their process any quicker. But no, it doesn't. Instead I was told i had to either go without a phone for over a week while i shipped it to them, it with thru procedures etc and then they made a decision what to do (repair or replace), or i could pay a convenience fee to get a replacement and THEN ship my phone to them. Not being able to go without my phone for an entire week (or more) I bit the bullet and paid their convenience fee today. This evening when i viewed my credit card, i got another surprise. Its not just the convenience fee i am being charged, its an estimated repair charge too. Despite the fact the phone is under warranty. How can they do this? Easy, they have they picture they insisted i send them showing a green line. The green line is damage, not a defect. Now i know why they insisted on getting the picture before they would proceed. This will be my last Motorola purchase. And likely an end to me being with Verizon once my contract is over in 2 years. From looking at the forums, Verizon is very aware of this issue also. Instead of backing their customers and making Motorola resolve the issue, they are refusing to get involved and will only direct the customer back to Motorola",

            "body": "I bought my turbo from the Verizon store over Christmas, & was told I had until the end of January to return due to the holiday season. I purchased the turbo solely for it's advertised 24-48 battery life, and 21 mega pixel camera. I immediately flew out of state to visit family for the holiday, which is also when I began using the phone. I immediately saw the phone last for maybe 4 hours .... if I was lucky. I wasn't immediately devastated, because I'd done my research before purchasing, and saw Motorola suggested giving the phone a few days of cycling through the battery before reaching its \"full potential\". In the meantime, my grandfather passed away (still during this trip) so I repeatedly extended my return date. I wasn't concerned about the turbo not making it past 4-6 hours still, because I had been quoted until the end of January to return it, AND, what company wouldn't understand a lemon when they heard these details, anyways? Combined with the unusual predicament I found myself in (which was provable by extrinsic evidence, no less). I returned home, devastated, and was able to get to the Verizon store two days past the 31st. Yes, I was late, but the phone was defective & my delay in returning it was not due to anything in my control. I had proof of my grandfather's death and funeral arrangements, and the travel arrangements and re-re arrangements, and was hoping the store would see the breach of of implied warranty of merchantability; the phone is mainly premised on it's 24-48 hr battery life, & I barely got 8% of that from day one, and it never improved, despite that whole cycling through crap. I didn't want not a different phone, or a return, but just what I paid for before I left town, & exactly what Motorola advertised the phone as doing: a new phone with a decent battery life. I hoped for 24, not 48, but honestly would have been happy to just make it home from work on the same charge. Nope. Totally nope. Not just Verizon, I went straight to Motorola. Citing the UCC, which protects consumers from this very thing, and includes both express and implied warranties of merchantability. I called. I write letters. I went in person. I had a legitimate dud, and was in an honest predicament, but they wouldn't replace my phone with another new turbo? The best I was offered by either Motorola or Verizon was a used turbo. Sometimes leftovers. They tried to polish it up by the whole \"refurbished\" title, but that doesn't change the fact that they sent me something that used to be in someone else's pocket and returned it after changing their mind, despite the fact that I'd just recently paid full price for a new phone, not a used one. If I'd wanted someone else's sloppy seconds, I'd surely have paid less for that. But that's what I got. I could only muster up so much energy for this argument on my phone. Despite knowing I was right, I had no choice. Without a removable battery, I couldn't be without a phone in operation. I gave in and accepted the used replacement. But the first used replacement wasn't much better. I am not an overly aggressive user. Sometimes I use the phone more than others, but there were mornings I didn't use it at all at work and was at 30% by 11. I don't understand. The phone is supposed to be 24-48. I tried having another sent to me, and had slightly better luck with the third turbo (second used one to replace my new one that was a lemon). This one made it to 6-7 hours sometimes, but only with super light use, so I tolerated it. I had to buy a small portable charger to carry in my purse, though, because it still would did at 4 hours sometimes. After two months it stopped taking a charge completely, and I just gave up completely and gave it back to Verizon, moving on from the painful experience with a huge ding in my pocketbook. Motorola used to be my favorite go to phone company, but they dumped me off to each other division and segment when I was seeking resolution with my initial lemon on this unfortunately marketed device. The camera may have been 21 pixels, but it had very few options to do anything with them, and given my battery situation, I never used anything I didn't desperately need to use anyway. My experience was so poor, I'm never touching another Motorola anything. Ever.",

My old Droid Razr Maxx and every other phone I know of can do this. The Droid Turbo? Nope. Just no. So, you know, for things like talking while using your phone for navigation, e-mail, internet, pictures, documents, hot spot... forget about it. Your boss calls and says \"hey- you get that e-mail I sent you?\" and you have to say \"duhhh.. I dunno... let me call you back...\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Also, the \"ballistic nylon\" is stupid. It's cheap as hell. Run your fingernail across it (or anything), and it will fray. Look, if you are a simpleton and don't need data and voice at the same time (and there's nothing wrong with that... you'll probably just regret it later), don't get the ballistic nylon - get the Teflon coating. Wait... you're buying the most expensive smart phone and you don't use data and voice at the same time?? Why?",

            "body": "After my recent experiences with the Motorola Droid Turbo 64 gigabyte phone, I have come to a conclusion. This phone has to be one of the worst phones I have ever had in my life. This phone not only lived up to what everyone already says about droid phones, It exceeded those expectations. At first sight the phone was not the worst phone on the market, but over time it became the worst choice that I could possibly have chosen. The phone not only locked up on me, but my wireless carrier actually threw this phone on me and said this is what you could have and only this. When I first went to Verizon wireless to purchase a new phone they told me I had two options: either get the Droid Turbo or wait until my regular upgrade was available. After wanting a phone and listening to the reviews at the time I decided to try it. IT WAS THE WORST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!!! After having the phone for about 3 months I knew it was bad. The phone started to freeze on me, shut off uncontrollably, and make me miss important phone calls and text messages when I needed them the most. You need a phone that is reliable, not one that will decide when it wants to work or not. Hopefully if you own one of these phones you do not have these problems. In my experience with Motorola phones in general I have realized that this happens more often than not. Always, makes sure to read the product reviews and do your research before you sign your life away on a cell phone contract for 2 years. That is not something that you would want to do. Once, you realize or come to a realization of which phone suits you the most, go with your first instinct and get that phone. In conclusion, I would not recommend this phone at all. Due to its inconsistencies and unreliability when you are counting on your phone to work the most. When the time comes, which phone would you choose? The one not recommended by someone who has had it, or the phone that everybody else is getting but it is reliable in the end? That is the real question.",

Its got a great screen display, it runs well, and has an awesome motion sense activating screen. However, the main things that Motorola boasts with this phone, primarily its battery life and high quality camera, both didn't even remotely live up to the expectations. After a month of using this phone the battery life would die at 60% to 70% to 90% and then even at 100%! At first I believed that it was due to overheating as this phones CPU is quite powerful however this was not the case. The battery charges quickly, as advertised, but this doesn't matter if it cant hold a charge for more than a few seconds! The camera is also grainy and slow when using apps like Snapchat so take that into account as well. Overall, the potential drawbacks force me to recommend looking at other phones. I personally bought a new one today.",

            "body": "First off, I just wanna say this best device since the Motorola Moto G which was one of my favorites during its time. I ordered a Ballistic Nylon, but I got a smooth-backed one? I'm not complaining, because it turned out that Ballistic Nylon ones are harder to fit into cases. - The power! This Droid Turbo is incredible. I don't know how Motorola managed to squeeze a 2.7Ghz quad-core processor into this thing, but it's fast. I can swap from Facebook to NOVA 3 (an amazing fps game) without having to restart either application. - The battery! Now, when I first got the device, I was a bit skeptical about the battery life. Upon first usage of the device, I got about 3 hours out of the battery, BUT after a few battery-life-cycles, I can go about 3 days on light usage (text, talk, music, etc..). If I wanna play some games, browse through the Web, and check social media's, I will get about a day and half out of the battery. That's actually amazing for such a high clocked CPU. This phone does feature a wireless charging capability which works flawlessly. -The Display: Super AMOLED... SPECTACULAR. Enough said. -The camera: This wasn't very impressive, but still great. While the camera is stunning, it dies take a moment to focus... About 3 seconds, actually. There's also about 1 second delay upon snapping a picture and the phone actually snapping the picture. At least it's crazy quality, but this is horrible when trying to take pictures of 2 hyper cats. The video is amazing, capturing 4K HD like a boss. The front camera is great. It is actually very clear for a front camera. - overall, this is a beast of a device. I wouldn't trade it for the latest iPhone or Windows phone, because when it comes to Android, Droid does. I only wish there was a bigger selection of cases. Specifically, an aluminum alloy case with built-in tempered glass like the one I had for my Galaxy S4. Buy, Ghostek did nicely of this case I'm using now. Update: After about 4 months, the handset microphone stopped working. This means, no one I called from the device could hear me, though I could hear them clearly. Upon activating speakerphone, they could hear me slightly, but not clearly. I will, unfortunately, be taking off a star.",

It was much pricier than I wanted to pay, but my old one lasted 3 or 4 years and was the best smartphone I'd ever had and really the only one I could stand, so when the phone started to think the battery was dead and turn off at 52% charge consistently, I really wanted to get the same phone. I couldn't find a new one anywhere since they stopped making it and all the new phones I'd have to sacrifice half the battery life and half the camera megapixel if I want to stay with Verizon, so I felt this was worth the splurge to not use my upgrade through my contract. I don't know if I'm imagining it or the battery isn't lasting quite as long as the old one that could go a full day or two with constant use, but I have only used it to download and update apps and set up settings for many hours straight, so that might have been what did it. I like that I can take a picture and then crop a small section and still have a high quality photo with the 21 megapixel camera. I never zoom in on pictures though because I find the quality isn't as great. The battery really does last a lot longer than any other phone, so I never have to carry a portable charger and that was the main draw of this phone.",

            "body": "I got my Droid from Edge cellular. Item was listed \"As New\" and it matched the description, it was in mint condition. It took a few days to activate it on Verizon. I think the previous owner never registered it. I added the phone on my Motorola site, and surprise, it's still under warranty until April 2016. Now for the phone itself. Even if it's last year's flagship, I can still consider it top of the line right now. Everything is snappy, no lag, handles everything without a hitch. It may get a bit warm (not hot) during some heavy applications and games, but it's not an issue. Front speak is a bit weak, my Moto E 2nd gen gets louder, even though not that crisp. My biggest surprise was the battery. I was expecting something better. I think if the screen would have been 1080p instead of quad HD, you would get 50% more screen time. Right now I get less use compared to the Moto E, making it through the day. It's a good trade off though for the screen clarity and processor power.",

The only con so far is the speaker volume and quality. That's the reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5. I'm still tinkering with it and may find that it's a setting. So far I'm really pleased with it and would recommend it over Samsung or Apple.",

That phone is GORGEOUS and it seems a few years ahead of this one in terms of style and user functions. There are much fewer (visual) customization options available for the Droid Turbo, much to my chagrin, and the feel of it overall is just... cheap! Especially after handling the M8. I immediately disliked the Turbo, and if not for the quick charge capability, I would not be using it. :P",

            "body": "I had this phone for about a week before I dropped it on the ground and the screen shattered. I had a case and a glass screen protector on it, but it did nothing to protect it. I was really disappointed, especially since the phone was really nice to use. I tried to replace the screen, but that ended up being much more hassle than I anticipated, so I bought a used Droid Turbo to replace it instead. That one worked about 3 days before the screen went out. It looked like there had been water damage from previous use - one of the risks of buying a used phone. I didn't trust it after that, so I sent that one back for a refund. I really wanted to like this phone, I loved it when it worked. Now, it's just a junk backup phone in case my current phone craps out. I might try to fix it later on if I find the time, but I wouldn't recommend buying this unless 1. you buy new or refurbished and 2. you get a really good case for it. I ended up using my brother's old Samsung Galaxy s5 instead, it works much nicer. Pros: - Nice to use (when it worked) - Looks good Cons: - Screen broke after a week (1st phone) - Screen went out after 3 days (2nd phone) - Occasionally gets warm when in use",

            "body": "Summary: Nice phone, but why the ballistic nylon, why no SD card, why not totally waterproof, and why oh why so expensive? This is my 10th (or more) phone, having started with a big block of battery and electronics from the mid 90s. It's definitely the best so far, but I always feel dirty after spending many hundreds of dollars on a device that fits in my pocket and lasts just a couple of years. I upgraded from Droid MAXX, which still is a very nice phone. The biggest improvement over the MAXX for me is the camera. The Turbo doesn't feel much faster than the MAXX, and the battery is the same or even a little worse. You should get the wireless charger - it really saves money on USB cables and busted USB ports. - I really hate the fact that the Droids don't have expandable memory. 32GB is not enough on board storage, so I went with this one at 64GB, but then I'm forced to take the ballistic nylon back material. - Ballistic nylon comes unglued from the phone (but it's covered with the case, so it doesn't really matter). It's kind of a nice feel, but I'm never going to use a phone without at least a slim case, so I don't really care what the back looks or feels like. - At this price point, it should really be waterproof, like Samsung and Sony. - I know that this will be too slow in two years due to lack of long-term support from Google for Android - It's true, that pointy lower corner really does dig into your hand. With a case on, I can't feel it + Battery life = AWESOME, but I want MORE. I'd accept another 5mm thickness and 100g weight for more battery. If you ever used a battery like this or the MAXX, then you wonder how you ever got by with less than 24hrs of battery life. + Fast + Decent camera, or at least much better than Droid MAXX + Video is really VERY nice + NICE screen I docked a star for price, ballistic nylon, and lack of SD card",

            "body": "I will say from the beginning I am not a super techie phone person. This phone has a lot of great things it can do to make it useful, but what I was really looking for was something with enough battery life to get me through the day. I work outdoors and often have little to no cell service which can be a huge draw on the battery. My old phone often drained so fast I had to shut it off for the day to conserve enough battery in case of an emergency. I was a little reluctant to try this phone, as many reviewers stated they were not getting the full 48 hours of battery life advertised. I am happy to say I am not only getting 48 hours, but generally 72+ hours between charging (I just put the phone on the charger this morning - it was down to 7% after running for 3 1/2 days since it's last charge). I should clarify that I do NOT have my wi-fi on all the time (not much need in the woods), and I use the phone mostly as a phone for talking, texting, some email, and some internet browsing. I really like the fact that as the battery gets below 10% it doesn't take a nose dive down to 0 like my old phone, so is still usable for several hours even below 10%. There are many other reviews here listing the pros and cons of all the aspects of this phone, so I won't go there. I really wanted to share if you are looking for a nice phone with good battery life and use it more like a phone and not a computer, you should be pleased with the battery life of the Turbo. I have also read some negative reviews regarding the cell reception of this phone. It seems to work as well if not better than my HTC DNA out in the woods. In general I would say I have slightly better reception in areas of low reception than I did with my old phone. My only criticism (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars) is it's a little big. Only slightly bigger than the DNA, but that difference is enough that I have a hard time doing anything one handed. I have pretty small hands, and the DNA seemed to be a perfect size for me. The slightly thicker and wider Turbo seems huge in my hand, but I guess I will get used to that. Overall, I really like the phone. Getting over 3 days of use between charges is great. I hate being a slave to my charger, and with the Turbo I am not.",

            "body": "Here's my experience so far. I've had it for 4 days. My last phone was a Droid Razr Maxx HD. It was a dual core processor. I really like the Droid Turbo. This thing is zippy. When you touch a button or control, it responds immediately. The startup time from off to fully operational takes about 25% of the time than it did for the Droid Razr. I have a better processor on my phone than I do on my laptop! Ok, the battery: People have been complaining that the battery isn't lasting as long as the Motorola statements. The first day I had this I charged it completely. I was downloading all kinds of apps, tweaking settings, I turned on every Moto feature including the one where it listened to every word I said and waited like the most well trained dog on the planet just to hear one phrase. (Let me just say that I find that a little unsettling; I'm not big into conspiracy theories, nor am I highly paranoid, there's gotta be some folks out there that are worrying that Google is recording everything). Back to the battery: The battery last about 17 hours including when I was sleeping on the first day. Now, the second day, I turned off all the Moto features, disabled all the bloatware that got loaded by Motorola or Google or Verizon (whatever); now I was back to my daily routine. I am not a gamer. I do watch YouTube videos, I had to test my Chrome Cast. Read lots of emails and made a few phone calls and nitpicked a few settings. Bluetooth was off. Brightness on Auto. After 60.5 hours (2 Days, 12.5 hours) I still have 27% juice left. That includes two nights of sleep. Stats: 24% standby, 19% screen, 17% Wi-Fi, 10% Google Play Services, 10% Idle, 6% Android System, 6% Android OS, 5% Google Apps. The Droid Razr didn't do quite as well after 2 years. Maybe after 2 years the Droid Turbo will lose a little battery strength. Do I care if I can't take out the battery? Nope. The Razr wouldn't allow that either. Charging: Wow! Yup Wow! I wasn't watching too close, but I swear it took less than 2 hours to go from less than 20% to full. The screen is much larger, but I'm enjoying that because my reading glasses aren't always with me. I really don't notice much of a difference in picture quality. The video quality is nice. I am really disappointed that there is no LED notification. What were ya thinkin' Moto!? I relied on that light. I had set email and text messages to be a different color. If the light was flashing green, I had a text. Now what do I get????? The screen gently displays a symbol from the notifying app every few seconds. I can't see that from an angle. Fail! The new sensor across the top of the phone is a great feature. All I have to do is move my hand near it and it displays the status (time and notifications). No having to push the power button just to read the time or see if I have a text. I'm still leaving off the other feature of waving my hand to silence the phone. Don't know if I'll use it unless I find myself having more meetings. I probably won't use Droid Zap. Sharing files instantly with others is not a big deal to me. The camera quality is very good. I can select the focus area, tap the screen or push the volume button to take a picture. Haven't seen any drawbacks yet. I like that I can shake the phone and can be taking pictures in about 3 seconds! The sound quality is on par with previous phones. No problems with the speaker phone even though the speaker is facing forward now. I tested to see if I was cutting out off others or they were interrupting me. No issues. I have the nylon ballistic case. It is slippery. Solved by putting sticky dots on the back. Stop buying screen protectors. My Razr never had one; not a scratch on it. Gorilla glass solved that problem. You might as well buy one of those useless antenna stickers you put on your battery to improve reception while your at it. Pros: Battery (great time between charges) Charging (phenomenal) Performance (fantastic) Screen size and quality (good) Sound (good) Camera (good) Cons: No LED notification light (sadly shaking my head) I can still see smudges on the screen (ha, good luck with that) Not fully waterproof (not a big deal)",

            "body": "The best phone I've ever had the pleasure to use. While not everything is perfect, it's just really, really good. First, a caveat: This phone has no removable battery, and no expandable memory. For me, that's fine. I don't need so much room as to require more storage, and I just hook up the phone to my laptop for transfers. As for the battery, the battery technology used allows for more juice in a smaller package, conforming to the phone's shape. This means you can't remove it, but it also keeps it from being huge. And a 3900 maH battery would normally be huge. Plus, these batteries aren't like what you're used to: they don't die after a year of use, and won't need to be replaced. If they do, the warranty will cover replacement of the phone. Now to the review: Performance: With a nearly bare-bones KitKat OS, this thing is snappy. With noTouchWiz or Sense or any other user interface on top of it, the phone just responds so quickly. With a top-tier CPU and GPU, there's nothing you can't do with this phone. It's consistently at the top of the benchmarks, and its 3GB RAM allows you to move along without having to keep shutting down other apps. Camera: Great pics - nice and sharp. I would have liked image stabilization, as well as a touch better low-light performance. Plus, the default camera app has a very slow response from the time you tap it to the time the picture is taken. Other camera apps don't exhibit such latency, so it's a software problem. Additionally, I can't for the life of me figure out how to change the resolution or compression schemes to make for file sizes more appropriate for sharing over text or social media. It's a beast of a camera, and the video is 1080p or better (720p on slow-motion), but how do you make it smaller without using a 3rd-party app? Disappointing, regardless of the quality of the snaps. Sound: Nice and loud, no background hiss or boominess. That said, it does break up a bit at high volumes. Call Quality: So far, it's better than my previous phones. My last phone was the HTC Droid DNA, and the Motorola DROID Turbo just sounds better. Battery: Around 1-2 days of battery life with mixed use. Quick charger is the real deal as well. Software: Motorola loves their Moto apps. And they ARE really useful. Unfortunately, they also seem to be inconsistent. Maybe it's just me. I personalized my phone so when I say \"Wake up, Chewie!\", it would be ready for my instructions. For example, when I say my phrase, it should beep (to tell me it's ready), and then I should be able to ask about last night's basketball game, or tell it to set an alarm. When it works, it's pretty cool. Unfortunately, it often ignores my phrase. I've changed it to something more normal, yet it makes no difference. It's not due to the way I say it, and it's not due to background noise. It's just inconsistent. That said, I like the fact that I can tell it I'm going to bed so it'll go silent. And that if I'm in a meeting, it'll respond to calls with a notification text saying so. When I'm in the car, it will read me my texts and allow full hands-free operation with no extra setup. I love that. When it works. So, bottom line: I love this phone. I want to love it more, but Motorola has some work to do on the software. Being a Verizon-only phone hurts it, as does the fact that Verizon still hasn't approved of an upgrade to Android 5.0+ (Lollipop) yet. That should happen soon. Maybe. Pros: Fast, good looking, sharp camera, loud, bare-bones OS, tremendous battery life Cons: No removable battery, no expandable memory. no image stabilization, some software quirks Recommendation: If you're on Verizon and want a new phone, this one's really worth the look. Best on the market - for now.",

            "title_review": "Nice phone, but don't expect 48 hours of battery life...",
            "body": "I bought this phone to replace my Droid Razr Maxx HD. The Razr Maxx HD had great battery life for about the first year too. I'm hoping the battery on this one holds out for the full 2 years. This is a nice upgrade from my old phone. It runs faster, sounds good and hasn't given me any issues. I haven't had any dropped calls either. You can ignore the 48 hour battery claims. Unless you never touch the phone, that just won't happen. I use my phone a lot and play games on it as well. I usually get 14-18 hours out of it. I LOVE the motorola additions (Moto voice, Moto Assist, Moto Actions). It's great to have the phone offer to read you an incoming text message while you are driving. I also have my phone go into \"Sleeping\" mode to keep my phone quiet and dark while I sleep BUT it still allows contacts I choose (like my wife and daughter) to ring through. For those who care about the OS, it is currently at Android 4.4.4. According to news reports, it will be updated to Jellybean 5.1 but they are not saying when. I would say the only thing I don't like when compared to my old phone, is that it does not have an SD card slot. There is no way to expand the storage. What you buy is what you get. It seems to be the way all the phones are headed these days. Overall, this is a good phone with a battery that should easily get you through the day. I would recommend this phone to anyone on Verizon.",

The specs are all there, and the phone is attractive enough. Setup and personalization are OK. However, the phone immediately had some issues related to the vendor software: switching to speaker mode during a call worked, but could not be switched back to headset. Very annoying. Volume control during media playback seems to randomly affect ringtone levels instead. Pairing with vehicle systems (2 different manufacturers) is inconsistent and track data is not transmitted (apparently due to the lack of an enhanced AVRCP driver, something the Moto X had 2 years ago). More recently the phone began becoming very hot, seemingly at random but often when the charge level was low. Last week, after less than 3 months of use, it heated up again and the touchscreen stopped responding. After a reboot, the screen seems totally blank. Phone has gone back to Moto for a replacement, we will see how that process goes. Maybe I got a lemon, but at least 2 other folks at work with the same phone have also had issues.",

            "body": "So I read a lot of great reviews about this phone before I purchased and I will have to say they didn't do it justice. The Snapdragon quad core processor makes this phone extremely fast! It operates smoothly and fluidly. Apps open at amazing speeds as well as websites, downloads and uploads. Just awesome. Sorry I am not a \"techy\" person... The camera takes great pictures even in low light settings. One review I read said the nylon back actually made the phone less \"grippy\" but I don't agree. My old phone is the galaxy s4 and this one is much easier to grip and hold without feeling like it's going to slip out of my hands. I also read where with prolonged use the phone would get warm to the touch. So far I have not experienced this either. And I had ALOT of stuff open and running and videos going! This really is a \"cool\" but greatly functional phone!",

            "body": "Wow! Is this battery every going to die? I didn't expect the phone to be this good, but then again it's a Droid. I have owned all the Droid models except for the Droid 3 & 4. Waving your hand over the phone to check messages, indicators, calls, etc, is amazing. Buttons....what buttons! Screen is amazing. Speed is insane. This is faster than my computer. The red sticks out and is an attention grabber. Very good quality, well built. Motorola did an outstanding job. I bought this to avoid a new contract and from losing my unlimited plan. If you are considering this phone you won't be disappointed. I am not! Oh, and being able to speak and have your phone do whatever you want is pretty cool. And let's not forget this phone has wireless qi charging built it. All you need to do is purchase a good quality qi charger. I purchased an eco model built for the Turbo. And finally, the phone will ask if you want to protect via Motorola's phone finder app. If you say yes it will take care of the rest. If you ever lose or misplace your phone or need to \"wipe\" it, or trigger the alarm, etc, you go to Motorola's website and follow the instructions. Pretty cool indeed. Very happy.",

The last one died in my pocket while I slept. Not dropped, didn't go swimming with it, just died. Do not buy this if you live in a humid environment. You do not need to get them wet, condensation alone will kill them. This is a desert phone. I still owe about a hundred bucks on the first one and have to buy a phone, but it will not be an XT1254.

            "body": "I bought this phone for my wife. It's a pretty nice phone, except for the camera. There's a fair bit of delay taking pictures, even if you fiddle with the settings to speed up the process (turning off HDR, etc.). We ended up returning it to Amazon; my wife was repeatedly frustrated that the delay caused her to miss the shots she wanted when the camera was too slow. Otherwise, it's a nice phone. Great battery life, clean stock-Android interface and quick.",

Because of this, it was difficult to determine whether the phone was not working or whether I had received a damaged sim card. Either way, I probably wouldn't buy another phone that needs a sim card, because it just wasn't worth the hassle. I'll stick with iPhones.",

            "title_review": "Best... Phone... Ever........",
            "body": "I owned the original Samsung Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note 2. I skipped the Note 3 mostly because I didn't have any available upgrades on my family plan ;-). Plus I figured I'd skip a generation and get a much better Note. I purchased the Note 4, thought it was great, and then promptly returned it. \"Why\", do you ask? The answer is simple... ================================================= THE DROID TURBO IS THE BEST PHONE KNOWN TO MAN! ================================================= Before you kill me for saying this, hear me out. I'm not a fan boy. I don't work for Motorola. I've tried a number of the current flagship phones before deciding on the Turbo. Here are some of my thoughts on the other phones: - I tried the Note 4, thought it was great, and returned it. - I have the iPhone 6 Plus, loved it, planned to keep it, tried the Turbo, and now I'm looking to sell the 6 Plus. - I also owned the HTC ONE M8 for Windows, thought it was cool, was pleasantly surprised when it started reading text messages to me automatically while I was driving, but I returned it as I was worried about the ecosystem. - I briefly got my hands on the Nexus 6. Thought it was great. Was happy to see that it was made by Motorola, and was then quickly disappointed that it was missing the Motorola Apps and features found on the Moto X and Droid Turbo. In my opinion, the combination of great specs, a great screen, blistering performance, slap your momma long battery life, and most importantly, the unique suite of Moto Apps firmly places the Droid Turbo ahead of all other smartphones. \u2714 PROS: - Very nice screen - Fast Performance - Good (not great) camera - Double twist your wrist to launch the camera - The mother of all batteries (MOAB) - Trusted Devices: Keep your phone unlocked when it's near a trusted device (headset, fitness band, etc.) - Moto Voice: The Turbo is always listening for your commands, allowing you to use your phone without touching it - Moto Assist: The Turbo knows when you are home and allows you to accept/reject phone calls via verbal commands. When you are home or when you are driving, the Turbo allows you to hear and respond to text messages via verbal commands. The Turbo will also silence your phone during meetings - Moto Actions: Sensors detect hand gestures to let you activate your phone's screen without touching it. You can use this to see the current time, preview notifications, or wave off incoming calls - Moto Display: See notifications on your phone without touching the phone. You can preview and act on notification from the lock screen - Customizable \"Hello Google\", hands free voice command phrase. - Accurate voice recognition courtesy of an included secondary chip dedicated to natural language processing - Qi wireless charging support. Just buy a $20 wireless charger and you're set. - Turbo Charger support (get 8 hours of charge in only 15 minutes) - Very close to stock Android 4.4. In the past, Motorola has provided quick Android OS updates to its phones. - Cheaper than a Note 4 or iPhone 6 Plus (sans incentives, trade-in offers, etc.) - Solid, sturdy build. There won't be an iPhone 6 Plus type \"Bend-Gate\" for the Turbo. \u2714 CONS: - You won't get the advertised 48 hours of battery life - Camera has slow autofocus (after you use the iPhone 6 Plus, you notice slow autofocus much more) - Camera doesn't have optical image stabilization (WHY???!?!?!?!?1?ONE!?) - There's a slight delay between when the Turbo hears your hands-free voice command and when it performas the action - Volumes button are a tad flush to the body and takes a wee bit more effort to local them - Only one speaker - Phone can get warm to the touch - No available option for a larger screen that includes Moto Apps and the dedicated natural language chip - No SD Card slot - No fitness tracking related sensors - Mobile hotspot didn't work for a couple days after launch but it works now. - Simultaneous voice and data doesn't work at the time of this writing but should be added in a month or so. \u2714 OTHER - The Turbo was incorrectly reporting my location initially. It was saying I was in Washington, DC when I was actually in Virginia. I changed a setting (I don't remember which) and now it's fixed. - I like the nylon cover, although I suspect some people might not - It has dedicated capacitive buttons, not on screen buttons. I prefer dedicated buttons, but I wish the home button was a physical button, like on the Note 4. - The phone is water resistant, (NOT WATERPROOF!). - It's only available on Verizon (for now). We'll have to see if the rumored Droid Maxx and Moto X Play have the same specs and features. - Some users complain about call volume. I haven't experienced this issue. \u2714 USING THE DROID TURBO Here are some of the things I've done with the Turbo and why I think it's cool: - I can initiate a voice search without touching the Turbo. Yes, you can do this with many Android phones but on the Turbo, you can customize the command. For example, my launch phrase is \"Eagle One, come in!\" Since the Turbo has a dedicated, low power natural language processing chip, the launch command works more reliably on the Turbo that any other non-Motorola phone. Since the Turbo has a huge battery, you can leave this feature on and still get over a day of battery life. - Turbo knows when I am home. If I'm home when a call comes in, Turbo will say the name of the caller and ask me if I want to take the call. If I say \"listen\", Turbo will answer the call on speaker phone. If I say \"ignore\", Turbo will end the call. If the ignored caller has a mobile number in my contact list, Turbo will ask if I want to send the caller a text message. I can then speak my message to Turbo and Turbo will send it. I can do all of this without touching the Turbo. - Turbo will also announce incoming text messages when I'm home. I can listen to and reply to text messages without touching Turbo. - Turbo knows when I'm driving (or on a bus or train) and will also announce incoming text messages when I'm on the move. - A few times in the past couple of weeks I have taken calls from bed without getting out of bed. The Turbo can hear commands from across a room. - I've taken calls from the Turbo while sitting down, with the phone in my pocket. - I've participated in long text message threads with people while cooking dinner, all without touching my Turbo. The dedicated natural language processing chip rarely misunderstands what I am saying. - Need to take a quick photo? Twist your wrist twice while holding the Turbo to launch the camera app. You don't even have to unlock your phone. - Hate having to unlock your phone all the time? Feeling envious of Apple's fast and accurate Touch ID? Use Trusted Devices on the Turbo. With this functionality, you can keep your Turbo unlocked whenever it's connected to a trusted Bluetooth device you designate. This can be a BT headset, your car, or even your BT equipped home computer. I use my Microsoft Band as my trusted device. Yes, using Trusted Devices is a bit risky as someone can access your phone if your trusted device is nearby. - The big battery allows me to no longer do anything to preserve battery life. No more battery saving apps, no more turning apps off, no more turning off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Just leave everything on, bro. And since the Turbo has wireless charging built-in, if buy a couple of $20 wireless charging pads for the home, the car, and the office, your Turbo will never run out of power. \u2714 DROID TURBO vs SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4 The Note 4 has a better camera that includes OIS, a larger screen, and stylus pen support (a great advantage if you actually learn to use the pen). The Turbo has a turbo charger, built-in wireless charging, and a larger battery. The Turbo also has Moto Apps. I think more people will use the Moto Apps than they will use the Note 4 stylus pen. \u2714 DROID TURBO vs IPHONE 6 PLUS The iPhone 6 Plus has the best total camera experience on any smartphone, plus a larger screen. The 6 Plus also has the best ecosystem (apps, accessories, iTunes, enterprise support, desktop integration, mind share, etc.). Unless you are heavily invested in iTunes purchases or need the best smartphone camera, I think you should switch platforms. Moto Apps are just that good. Plus the 6 Plus lacks the big battery, turbo charging, and wireless charging. \u2714 DROID TURBO vs GOOGLE NEXUS 6 The Nexus 6 ships with Android 5.0 and can expect to get Android OS updates the quickest. The N6 has a larger screen and dual speakers. Its camera features a ring flash, OIS, and HDR+. If Motorola's past performance is an indicator, the Turbo can expected to get Android updates pretty quick, nerfing one of the N6's big advantages. Since Motorola makes both the N6 and the Turbo, I don't anticipate the Turbo will get updates much later than the N6. If the N6 had Moto Apps, the dedicated voice chip, and a bigger battery, I would get the N6. The N6 doesn't have these things so, to me, it loses to the Turbo. \u2714 BOTTOM LINE The Droid Turbo is the best phone available. Period. It has a great screen, blistering performance, and the best battery life. Its suite of Moto Apps destroys everything running on any other phone. While it's true that its camera is not as good as the Big 3 (Note 4, Nexus 6, iPhone 6 Plus), the camera isn't bad. It's actually pretty good, just not as good as the Big 3 cameras. I know I'm not crazy in writing this review. Several tech journalist have already suggested that the Moto X is the best Android phone available. Google \"moto x best phone ever\" and see for yourself. The Droid Turbo is a Moto X with a bigger battery, better camera, faster CPU, better screen, and more RAM. Thus, The Turbo is better than the \"best Android phone ever\". ;-) Rarely have I enjoyed using a phone so much that I would recommend people to switch platforms and even switch carriers to get the phone! The Turbo is that good. While other flagship phones provide largely the same user experience, the Turbo gives you a whole lot more. Of course, if you don't think you will make great use of the Moto Apps and the big battery, or if you need a bigger screen, you can't go wrong with the Note 4, Nexus 6, or iPhone 6 Plus. At the end of the day, these are all great phones. Tech Ranker . net",

            "title_review": "Droid on 'roids! Solid Maxx update w/ some bugs, and the battery is not all there...",
            "body": "I moved to the Turbo from last year's Droid Maxx. My prior phone was a Galaxy Nexus. Strung together, these phones represent a continuation of Google's post-Gingerbread aesthetic, when the Android OS really began to take user interface design seriously. Each of these devices run close-to-stock versions of Android (unfortunately 4.4.4 KitKat for the Turbo at launch), without the heavy, increasingly unnecessary skins by the names of Touch Wiz, Sense, Xpria, and MotoBlur. __________ Construction: The Turbo is somewhat unremarkable, and maybe plain, but ugly? Eye of the beholder and all, but... No. It certainly doesn't have the fashion sense of the Moto X, nor the industrial refinement of the HTC One. From the front, it's very similar to the Maxx. The primary visual differences are the smoked chrome bezel, and the front-facing \"eyebrow\" speaker that easily goes unnoticed. The always-present capacitive buttons were a conservative, questionable decision by Verizon, and like 'em or hate 'em, the phone will be stuck with them and be \"instantly outdated\" upon the update to Lollipop, when the button design will be changed to a Playstation-esq triangle, circle and square. The back of my 64 GB model is the \"ballistic nylon\" textured finish. First, I don't really believe that this is laid-up weave integrated with the phone. The pattern is too precise, too \"aligned and centered\" for me to go along with that -- I believe it's simply a back made of plastic (ok, fine, nylon, polymer, whatever...), with the simulated weave pattern molded in, replicating a heavy canvas-like material. I expected this textured finish to be \"grippier,\" i.e. less prone to slipping and dropping, than the smooth Kevlar back of my Droid Maxx, but quite the opposite is true: with the gentle way we hold, no, *cradle* our phones, maybe there's less surface contact between the fingertips and phone's back, but whatever the reason, the Turbo is more prone to sliding away. If you're at all clumsy and not planning to encase this device, it's worth checking out in-store. As it is, the ballistic nylon is the only option if you're opting for the 64 GB model. The 64GB model is void of any Verizon branding, other than a sensible DROID logo on the back (a Verizon trademark). Even the classic \"angry red\" Droid boot animation and default background has been toned down. No longer does the phone croak a robotic \"Droooooiiid\" during boot. _____ Phone: Call quality is exactly what I expect from Motorola. The sound is clear, the mics seem good judging by what the people I'm talking to are saying (it's not, \"You're scratchy -- say that again?\"). No problem with the Bluetooth functionality in my vehicles. The dialer is the recently updated white background, Material Design-themed version, and it's really snappy and responsive. It's funny to say that about a dial pad, but it really stands out to me how quick it is to respond to my finger press, and more importantly, my finger release -- previous dial pads have always had a bit of lag when I lift my finger to move to the next key. It sounds minor, but is in reality a big improvement in usability. ______ Screen: While I don't spend a lot of time ogling my phone, I *DO* look at my screen. The Maxx took a lot of heat last year for its 720p screen, when 1080p devices were all the rage. Personally, I found the 720 screen to be quite adequate, and I'm sure it helped with the battery-sipping properties of that model. However, I'll have to admit that the QHD display is absolutely stunning on the Turbo, even when watching 720p content on YouTube. But the extra resolution doesn't do me a bit of good on certain web sites where I hoped to most take advantage of it -- for instance, my local newspaper's web app, which only generates lower-res images of the paper for browsing. However, on text-heavy sites such as ARS Technica, where white text is displayed against a black background, GONE is the effect of the letters dimming when the screen is scrolled. Clearly, the technology driving this AMOLED screen has been refined. If you've fooled around at all with Google's \"Cardboard\" virtual reality goggles, this high res screen translates well, with individual pixels just perceptible enough to let you know they're there, without ruining the illusion. (Unfortunately, the magnetic switch on the goggles doesn't play well with the Turbo.) The screen, it's worth mentioning, has proven to be extremely oleophobic. My Maxx's screen was constantly obscured by finger smudges, while the Turbo stays very much unimpaired. I don't know if this is a coating that will eventually lose effectiveness, or is an innate property the glass, but I'm happy have it. ________ Sound: Perhaps my biggest criticism of the Maxx was the rear-firing, over-tasked speaker. It sounded over-driven from day one, with just a bit too much distortion at full volume. By contrast, the front firing speaker on the Turbo is not only facing the correct direction, but its output is crystal clean. Love it! It doesn't pack the volume to fill a room, and struggles to compete with the sounds of my morning shower with the exhaust fan running. But around the house, it's excellent for personal listening, and I can listen to a newscast from a room away. The speaker is is audible for in-car navigation, even over the radio at reasonable volume settings. Just don't expect it to be LOUD. ______ Radios: I'm sorry to report that the cellular and WiFi radios aren't as strong as those in the Maxx. I have a few reliable, repeatable \"dead spots\" in specific locations at home, work, and my favorite watering hole. Last year's Maxx surprised me and pulled weak but workable signals. With the Turbo, I'm back to no reception at these locations (one is a test of WiFi reception; the others of 3G/4G). This isn't a deal breaker, just a test of the functional limits of radio technology. But remember, the Maxx achieved the dubious notoriety as THE PHONE with the highest radiation output in 2014 -- if you concern yourself with that sort of data. I guess the trade-off there was exceptional radio range. On the topic of radios, in December the Turbo received an update to Verizon's \"Advanced Calling,\" aka VoLTE, i.e. \"Voice over LTE.\" If you're out and about, AND have a 4G connection, this phone will do simultaneous voice and data -- and at the same time provides a really nice voice connection to other Verizon users utilizing this feature. However, if the phone loses 4G, it drops the call. If you're in a 3G or 1x area and initiate a phone call while navigating or streaming music, you'll get an error message that the data connection was lost. If you're in range of a WiFi connection, voice + data are no problem. ______ Battery: Let's just say that battery life claims should always be viewed with skepticism. That's why I was surprised when last year's Maxx pretty much met Motorola's claimed 48-hour target. It's also why I'm surprised that the Turbo doesn't. Despite having an extra 400mAh under the hood (3900mAh battery, vs. 3500 in the Maxx), it has to drive a screen with 4x the resolution. Different processor, different launch OS, different features -- however this tallies up, my Maxx is comfortably an all-day \"plus\" phone (and I have my share of 24-plus hour days), which can include an hour of GPS navigation, an hour plus of video, some audio streaming, and lots of web usage -- much of it in an LTE-only environment. For my purposes, the all day battery is just great, but the Maxx (at launch) ran circles around the Turbo. The included Motorola \"Turbo Charger\" is the perfect solution to pumping another 16% into the battery in a mere 15 minutes, compared with a 6% boost from a non-Turbo charger from Motorola. At the discharge rates I'm experiencing, that's about 4 to 5 hours of additional usage time. Carried over from the Maxx is the built-in wireless charging using the Qi standard. Although you'll need to pick up a compatible charging stand separately, the Tylt Vu has no problem taking this huge battery from zero to 100 in less than 5 hours. ______ Camera: The out-of-the box camera experience is good, with some surprises. Moto's very useful \"twist to activate\" feature is present -- if you're not familiar, it's a simple trick to torque my wrist twice (like turning a door knob) to call up the camera app. Because of this, I live without a camera icon on my home screen, as the quick motion opens the app nearly instantly, even when asleep and locked. Overall, exposure, color, and focus are excellent -- I take no exception with the output quality, although I do call into the question the obscene 21 MP photo size. Long-pressing the screen to capture multiple shots in continuous drive mode results in a seriously impressive burst rate of 5 frames per second, but I am disappointed the first shot takes about 1.5 to 2 seconds to capture -- that's a bit slow, though I hope can be addressed in a future firmware update. __________ Performance: I'll leave it to the tech sites to relate benchmark data from the Turbo's chipset (which, from the ones I've read, show it on top of the heap of current devices). Here are some real life day-to-day observations. Boot time is 26 seconds to lock screen, and 35 seconds to \"ready to use.\" Facebook initialization (after downloading a FB app update, for instance) was literally taking minutes on the Maxx (you can read users complaining about this in the app's reviews). On the Turbo, this \"blue screen\" initialization time has been reduced to less than 15 seconds. In general, task switching and in-app page changes are instant. The hallmark of an overtasked processor is when I realize that I'm waiting for an animation to take place during a task switch or in-app page change. None of that here. It's an all-around fluid visual experience. Dalvik runtime is the default at launch. I haven't tried ART on the Turbo, and will probably wait until Lollipop to do so, but I was running ART on my Maxx for the last few months without any hiccups. ______ Memory: Google has definitely stepped away from expandable memory via SD slots, as evidenced by the last few generations of Nexus devices, and it seems that Verizon and Motorola are both on that train. Like the Maxx before it, the Turbo has no expandable memory, but the 64GB option should make amends to SD diehards. At a $50 price premium, it's a relatively good deal considering most phones up to now charge that much to upgrade from 16GB to 32. There is good news. The Maxx is OTG (\"On The Go\") compatible, via the micro USB slot. This means the phone natively supports my Leef microUSB reader, so I can still easily swap files should I have the need. The Leef device is postage stamp small, about matchbook thick, so it's not something that would be left plugged in all the time. But its presence wouldn't hamper watching movies on the airplane, or plugging in extra tunes in the car (except it blocks the USB port from accepting a power cable). ______________ Operating System: These comments will lose their substance quickly, as I expect the Turbo to transition to Lollipop in short order. Additionally, as Motorola perfected with the Maxx, they have a great deal of control over various functions of the OS that previously would have been \"baked in,\" requiring an OS refresh -- Moto has shifted much of that to the app side, and is able to make ongoing improvements through Google Play. Case in point: \"OK Google Now\" commands were initially answered with, \"Opening Google...\" before reading or displaying results. Less than a week into ownership, Moto updated their Moto Voice app to eliminate that small annoyance. There have likewise been minor app updates to Moto Actions and Connect. Present are all of the Moto goodies: Active display (notifications displayed on-screen while the phone is in standby mode), Moto Voice (\"OK Google Now\" or a phrase of my choosing to wake), Moto Actions (senses if I'm driving, sleeping, in a meeting, etc. and adjusts behavior accordingly, i.e. reading text messages aloud in the car and prompting me to respond by voice dictation). \"Attentive Display\" optionally uses the front camera to sense whether the screen is being looked at to remain on -- and it works well, but in practice is only useful with screen timeout settings in the 30 second to 1 minute range. \"Trusted Devices\" carries over, allowing the bypass of the lock screen when connected to a known Bluetooth device; alas, this feature still doesn't work with WiFi, so I continue to disable it and use the excellent SkipLock app instead. The OS is devoid of any skin-over, and as Moto has been doing for the past two years, is about as close to stock Android as can be hoped for -- just a few minor tweaks in the Settings menu. Verizon got their bloatware, but it's only present in the form of applications, which can easily be disabled and hidden from view. You'll find the usual pre-installed Amazon, Audible, IMDB, NFL, Softcard (ISIS mobile payments) apps in there, in addition to Verizon's Cloud, Message+, VZ Navigator (really, Verizon?!?) and others -- I've rolled back and disabled 15 pre-installed apps in total, though they can't be completely deleted, so remain present in memory. The apps I most use that potentially get \"under the skin\" of Android are all work without drama: Nova Launcher, Sound Profile, Skip Lock, and Swype keyboard. ____ Bugs: Thankfully, not too many. This mostly picks up where the Maxx left off. I've had the odd case of the clock, WiFi, and signal strength icons showing up upside down on the left side of my status bar. On occasion YouTube video playback freezes while the audio continues. There have been a few \"low battery\" shutdowns when I'm at 30% remaining, and launch something processor-intensive such as Google Earth, YouTube, or Cardboard -- but these have been isolated, non-repeatable instances where the phone picks right back up after reboot. All-in-all, I haven't experienced any recurring stability issues, random reboots, or missed calls. _______ Summary: If you're already a Droid Maxx user, or have the S5 or HTC ONE or newer, there is probably limited justification in picking up the Turbo. The Turbo's upped screen res, fast processor, and forward firing speaker are nice, but the Maxx remains a very usable device, with a Lollipop commitment from Motorola. The biggest knocks against the Turbo are notable: battery life is nowhere near what's claimed, and the camera is very slow to fire its first shot. I'm wavering between 4 and 5 stars for my rating, but the truth is, I *love* the phone, despite the shortcomings I've listed. Added together, all of these refinements over the previous generation make for an appealing update to an already solid phone.",

            "title_review": "I'd like to give the community some insight in return for ...",
            "body": "I've had the Droid Turbo for a little over two weeks now, and while I didn't purchase it through Amazon, I'd like to give the community some insight in return for all of their assistance. My usage ranges from light to moderate and includes fairly heavy texting, several phone calls, browsing the web, utilizing Google Maps on occasion, banking applications and somewhat heavy use in the app iFunny. DISPLAY The colors are fantastic, and don't appear washed out or over-saturated. Pictures are sharp and crisp looking. Touch reception is accurate and consistent, despite my screen protector. Outside viewing is acceptable as well as viewing angles. The screen itself can get plenty bright, but doesn't dim very well; even on its lowest setting, it still casts quite a glow and can be annoying at times in complete darkness. I recommend keeping the display on 'auto', then fine tuning to your specific needs as the day progresses. Overall though, that is very minor and I have otherwise been very impressed. 5/5 DESIGN The uni-body design gives this phone a very premium and sturdy feel. It's heavier than most smartphones, but I find pleasure in that rather than distaste. Makes me feel like I'm holding something actually worth the money I put into it. I have extremely small hands for a man, so I do wish it was slightly smaller, but have managed to utilize this device one handed fairly easily. It's a little awkward at times but manageable. The touch buttons are logical and placed well within reach of my thumb. The fact that they are capacitive as opposed to resistive will be a matter of preference; I for one enjoy the buttons as they are. The glass fiber backing is pretty slick, but solid and can take a small beating without a case (speaking from experience). The volume and lock toggles, while textured, are still not very pronounced, especially the volume one. I find myself tapping it several times before I get it to do what I want, but I feel that it will become second nature the more I use the phone. Satisfied overall. 4/5 BATTERY Because my usage is probably lighter than most users my age, my ability to get two days of use easily out this phone should be regarded carefully. I've been charging every other day now for about fifteen days, and I've always had between twenty and thirty percent left. I could probably squeeze another half day or so out of it, but am perfectly satisfied with its performance. I'd wager even under heavy use, a day shouldn't be difficult to achieve. My one complaint is that it is non-removable. No matter how good a battery is, even one such as this, eventually it won't be able to hold a charge at all and an entire new phone is going to be needed. Had to dock a point for that, since I'd much rather swap out a battery then an entire phone, even if I'm sacrificing longevity to do so. But that is a matter of opinion. Get a smart charger for maximizing the battery's life, and avoid overcharging as best you can, since that is the number one killer of Lithium Ion. 4/5 PERFORMANCE Snappy and responsive, plain and simple. Haven't had so much as a hiccup on anything. At idle, CPU averages 3% with 1.5GB of RAM free for use after all my needed apps are installed and running. But I do not game on my phone, nor do I plan to, so except for some intensive banking, I'm not really stressing any of the chips. Why'd I get such a fast quad-core with 3GB of RAM then? I like to think ahead, and if I plan to do something CPU/RAM intense, I like the fact that my phone will be able to stand up to the plate. I want my phone to meet my current needs and any plausible futuristic ones I may have. 5/5 INTERFACE/SOFTWARE The Droid UI is one I am familiar with, having had the Droid Mini a couple years previous. I like the Droid approach to Android, it doesn't have a lot of the 'prettiness' that other interfaces seem to have, such as LG or Samsung. The look and feel is straightforward, plain and practical. And that's what I like; if you prefer a more gussied up look, the Droid interface probably isn't for you. I'd recommend playing with it first before buying. Being a Verizon phone, the typical bloatware is included, but can be easily disabled and removed completely if needed (some phones let you disable but not uninstall; Droid allows both for several apps). Customization is as expected when it comes to any Android phone. I only use one home screen, as my OCD kicks in if I have more than one, and I'm glad Droid allows to me to get rid of the others. 5/5 STORAGE 32GB is plenty for my current needs, however I do wish there was an option for expandable memory. It's 2015, that should be a default option for smartphones nowadays. And while I don't plan on using more than 32GB (~23GB available to user), it would still be nice to have that option. Yes there is cloud storage, but I'm a lil old fashioned and prefer my storage as physical as possible when I can. 3/5 CAMERA It's a phone that takes pictures, that's all I'd ever want out of a camera that's attached to phone. Pictures come out very sharp and clear as does video. That's really all I can say about it; I take pictures of my cat and the occasional family photo, nothing really groundbreaking that would require professional looks, so this fits my need perfectly. The video is also extremely sharp and audio has come out at a respectable volume and clarity. 5/5 CONNECTIVITY Wi-Fi has been stable, strong and consistent. No trouble connecting to other routers. Call quality is acceptable, with me sounding exceptionally clear while others can sometimes be muffled, though I am told this is mainly attributed to Advanced Calling 1.0, which is still pretty buggy since its release. I usually have 3+ bars being in a fairly big city, so overall the experience has been positive. Speaker is a decent volume and clarity. Volume during calls is somewhat low, even when maxed out. I suspect a software patch could be a fix. 4/5 AUDIO Most fault the Turbo for terrible quality, yet I find it very acceptable. It's a phone and not meant for awesome sound so why expect it? That said, I've played Pandora through the speakers and even over the sound of my shower it sounds great. It's clear and even has some thump to it. Granted, it's no where near something like the M8, but for what it is I say it's darn great. Can get a little distorted when on full blast though, but that is minor in my eyes since I don't usually use my phone for music. 5/5 TL;DR The phone is a beast, able to get me through two days easily with light to moderate usage. Phone does get hot with heavy use, however I've been told this is normal and in retrospect, it does cool down quite fast. It's a decent size phone, probably not for really tiny hands but still manageable. Love the feel of it and the Droid UI. Recommend some kind of wrap or slim case for grippage. Really wish the battery was removable and it had the option for additional storage, but the pros far outweigh the cons. I would recommend as long as one is familiar with the Droid UI and has experience in their previous lineup, since it can be a little frustrating fresh-off-the-boat with other brands like LG or Samsung.",

Turbo will not plat Windows media files like my old Razor M. I called Motorolla support and they admitted that the Turbo did not support that file format. I originally ripped cd's a few years ago and that was the default on my win 7 laptop at the time. 2. The Android Kit Kat is a slightly newer version than my old Razor but takes up twice the space on the internal memory. 8.37 gb. If I knew that I might have spent the extra $ for the 64 gb version. 3.

            "body": "This is the best cell phone you can get right now. Period. Processing Power: The Unit uses the Snapdragon 805 processor which is the best one out right now clocked at 2.7 ghz. Navigation in this phone is smooth and buttery with Android Kitkat and is soon to have the new Lollipop update as well. The processor makes running programs a breeze and can handle even the most labor intensive apps out there. The Adreno 420 gpu is an absolute boss. Gaming with this little thing is amazing delivering good frame rate and I have not experienced any frame rate drops or hickups so far. The 3 gb of ram will allow you to seamlessly multitask between numerous apps without any delays in performance. The unit is a powerhouse. The Display: The Quad HD AMOLED display is beautiful and crisp. There are no noticeable backlight issues and the viewing angles are great. Using the phone out in sunlight is satisfactory and minimizes glare. The Camera: Though it is stated that the unit is 21 mp, I found the picture quality is mostly washed out. Also the camera app is bare bones and hardly allows for any type of customization. The front camera is extremely laggy in low lighting. I feel like this is a software issue but Motorola DEFINITELY needs to get this problem fixed as soon as possible. The Design: The phone is beautiful and the ballistic nylon adds a very nice touch to it. I love the feeling of holding the phone and it has a nice grip from the nylon which keeps it from slipping. Even though the unit is 5.2 inches, my tiny hands became adjusted to it very nicely. Battery Life: With the 3900 mAh battery you can expect this unit to go for a day and a half with no additional charge needed even with such a high pixel density screen and processor. Conclusion: I really do love this phone and I found the only flaw that it has is the camera but Motorola's older phones seem to have the same issue as well. The unit is a powerhouse and if you are looking for the belt of the best in cellular processing at the moment. Then go with the motorola droid TURBO!",

            "body": "This phone turns off suddenly even if the geo-location, wi-fi and/or mobile data reception options are turned off. I have seen it turning off while having 35%, 40%, 50% and even 70% of charge in the battery. Trying to turn it on again is useless because it always turns off again. It's a drag to be constantly looking for power outlets everywhere you go and be hooked to them if you're lucky to find one; also, using the camera turns it off instantly even if the phone displays a decent amount of battery charge. If I recall correctly,the battery in Motorola phones is fixed to the hardware frame so, replacing it isn't a choice. And also, this phone heats tremendously. A \"feature\" which I have already noticed in other Motorola phones.",

            "body": "I have long been a Motorola user, dating back to the DROID X in 2010. Not all of the phones were great, but I've yet to find smartphones with build quality and call quality that could even begin to compete the Droid line. In the last year or two Motorola has really turned things around and I consider their phones to be the best on the US Market. For about 6 months before I got the Turbo I had a LG G3 after making a switch for billing reasons. The G3 was fine, but I missed many of the Motorola features added on to a \"pure\" Android experience. I got my Turbo about a week ago and it felt like going home to an old friend. Moto Voice, Moto Assist, and Touchless Controls are some of the best features of any Smartphone manufacturer. With the Turbo, the added gesture controls, beautiful display, Turbo charging capabilities, near 2-day battery life, and more, I don't think I've every been happier with a phone. I'm very happy to have gone back to the Droid line, and recommend this as THE phone to buy on Verizon right now.",

            "body": "My business partner and I both got new phones. He bought the Droid Turbo and I bought the LG G4 and he was coming from the Droid Maxx and me the Note 4. Regardless of the carrier we have poor reception inside our office because of a metal roof, but our older phones averaged 95 to 105 dbm and so reception was rarely a problem. We were both anxious to see how our new phones performed inside our office and my G4 was in the 90 to 100 range and my business partners Droid Turbo was between 120 and 127 and he consistently dropped calls whereas my G4 had no problems. The next morning when we arrived at work my business partner told me that he dropped the same call 5 times on the way in and on this same route he never dropped a call on his Maxx so we knew there was a problem. He gave it about a week before he got so frustrated that he took it to the closest Verizon Corporate store and explained the problem. They were very nice and offered to switch the SIM card, but that rarely if ever resolves a signal strength problem so he requested another new Turbo and they set him up. When he got back to our office we immediately checked the dbm's and they were exactly the same so I decided to jump online and see if anyone else was experiencing the same problem and I found plenty of unhappy Turbo owners. We should have done the research up front, but both of us have had several Motorola phones and signal strength was never a problem on any of them. He gave the replacement phone a 24 hour test run and dropped the same call 3 times going home and 3 times coming to work the next morning. The gentleman at Verizon had told him to bring it back if the problem persisted so he did and replaced the Droid Turbo with a G4 and the signal strength is great just like mine. We are in the suburbs of Atlanta where signal strength is not something we never worry about (except at work) with any of the carriers, especially Verizon, so its obvious that Motorola blew it with the antennas on the Turbo.",

            "body": "I am flat-out in love with this phone. We had gone into the Verizon store intending to get Samsung Galaxy 5 phones, but they were offering this phone for \"free\" (with 2-year renewal, of course) and when the representative heard we were looking for good battery life she recommended the Droid Turbo. We started out with Droid phones for our first smartphone, and we really liked them. These were upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus; our first two were so bad (husband's rebooted constantly, and mine kept locking up) we had to return them for replacements. The Galaxy Nexus was a useful phone, but it ate battery way out of proportion of what I did with it. We had to have two spare batteries just to get through a long day at a SF convention. But I've never been \"in love\" with a phone until this Turbo. The battery life isn't what the specs say, but I can play podcasts all day, check the weather, send texts, make calls, use Waze and still have battery life at the end of the day without having to charge it; sometimes it doesn't go under 50 percent. That is downright amazing compared to the old Nexus. I love the Moto Voice feature in which you address the phone with a customized pass phrase and it will call someone on your contact list, look up the temperature outside, post to Facebook, and/or feed you the headlines. The screen is absolutely gorgeous; from photographs on Facebook to YouTube videos to the icons on your screen, the picture is sharp-edged and brilliant with vivid colors. The response time is quick. The camera isn't bad at all, except for a slightly slow response time, and I frequenly find myself leaving my camera behind for small parties and close-up photography because the phone app does the job so well. Sound is good considering it's a phone and I can finally hear it; I could turn the Nexus up to full volume and still not be able to make out what was being said. As far as I can tell, there's nothing this phone can't do, or I haven't run into it yet.",

            "body": "So I was upgrading from my Droid 4. The biggest thing on my mind was that I needed power. I run many productivity apps that my Droid 4 became sluggish (even after I do a wipe each month). After receiving this directly from Verizon and testing it out this is what I found: PROS: 2.7GhZ CPU (@ 4cores - not 8), 3GB RAM, 32GB space - plenty for anyone not planning on watching media (holds a good amount of music), the images are astonishingly vivid and crisp on the screen. Weight quite light (for its size). The camera is very nice at 21MPx but I don't use the camera features on my phones. CONS: This is where I wished I had really read the reviews prior to purchasing. The GUI sucks in this version of Android, I (along with dozens of others have immediately (literally upon turning the device on) installed a custom loader page. The icons and configuration makes me feel like I'm using a device from 10 years ago. Use a 3rd party GUI to fix that. There is NO slot for an expansion card. The speaker is on the front (unlike the Droid 4 which had a separate audio speaker on the back). This speaker is also very weak. Tested several audio samples on both devices (Droid 4 vs Turbo). The Turbo's sound quality simply sucks; almost unbearable for a device that is supposed to have this perk (play audio and video). The Droid 4 is much much stronger. A personal issue for me is that the charge port is on the bottom portion of the phone. Since I like using the Verizon belt clip and case, having the port on the bottom when the kickstand has the phone standing tall is not too pleasing - but not relevant for most. If you are looking to use it for basic activities, then this is great - has lots of power with a few tweaks to customize it to your liking. But this device is not for those who like to have many options to tweak. This phone comes with some crappy stock configurations and 1/2 of the media quality (video - not sound). I know there are a few other phones with the same 3GB of RAM but slightly less CPU (~2.1-2.5GhZ). For the price, it's not too bad.",

I even had bought the $40 tempered glass cover. Two of the cracks may just be the tempered glass cover but the one is for sure the actual screen. My husband now has the same problem with his and he doesn't have the cover. We realized why Verizon was so quick to get out the new Droid Turbo and its selling point is...you guessed it, shatter proof screen! I guess they figured out the design flaw a little too late. I haven't been to Verizon or Costco to fix the problem but I'm pretty sure they will do nothing for me except sell me a new phone. :(",

From the beginning, when I put the phone up to my ear it did all kinds of crazy stuff, mostly, dialed other numbers to join calls. It always disconnected my calls. The first few weeks I thought I was doing something wrong. I returned to the Verizon store, they checked it out and agreed it was defective. They shipped out a used replacement. It immediately had issues also. While inactive it would vibrate then freeze, rebooting after a hour or two, etc. Along comes #3. Activated on a Friday, Saturday, freezing, rebooting, rebooting every time I try to activate the screen to use the phone. Verizon will not return my money and will only ship another \"refurbished\" used phone. Am now trying to get somewhere with Motorola. Will update this review after that conversation. I find it hard to believe there is nothing I can do to correct this. Three phones in three months, all malfunctioning. And I paid for the Verizon Protect which does nothing for me on this issue. Verizon also disclosed to me that Motorola has been purchased two times in the last two years. Each new company making changes and it is in the process of being purchased right now by yet another company and the Motorola name will be no more.",

The battery very slowly dies out: First it won't turbo charge unless powered off, then no turbo charging at all, and then the battery doesn't hold a charge at all: it recognizes it's plugged in, but will not charge at all. If your battery works, it's a fantastic phone. Otherwise you end up with a shatterproof brick.",

The day after receiving the device the phone fell, and shattered its screen completely- from only 8 inches! Gorilla Glass 3 can suck it. After optimizing the phone to only run on 3G, lowest screen brightness with black wallpaper, and turning off all background functions the phone barely lasted half as long as Verizon claimed it would. On the other hand, I've never been as happy as I am with my Blu Phone Studio Energy, which lasts 48 hours of heavy use. I highly suspect most other reviews here of being paid for. This phone sucks, and I hate it for that reason in addition to it not being anything close to accurately reflecting the device it is marketed as. Word Word",

Verizon and Motorola make the claim that this phone is hardy and can handle some wear and tear. I have found that this is the most fragile phone i have ever owned. The screen has cracked two times with me. One time it fell out of my pocket while changing so from 2 or 3 feet above the ground and the whole thing shattered, although it could still be used. In hindsight i shouldve tried replacing the screen. Then two weeks later i was taking off my pants and it was still in the pocket. (it was not cracked when i put it in the pocket) When i took the phone out there was a tiny crack in the screen and then the bleeding started and within 24 hours the entire phone was inoperable. Verizon has refused to help in anyway. If i could get another phone i would. In addition to it being fragile the battery life is not that good, 18 hours has been my experience. Im locked into this phone for 2 years now and it sucks. I would say the other bells and whistles are nice but if i cant use it because its broken whats the point? Ill come back and submit a photo later.",

            "body": "Don't ever buy a refurbished Apple product. I bought a 5th generation iPod in April for about $175. The battery life started to degrade within a week or 2. After less than 20 uses at the gym, the battery lasted less than 15 minutes when fully charged. So, I ordered a replacement battery kit and when I took the refurbed unit apart today, I discovered that several internal clips were broken and 2 mounting screws were missing from a previous shoddy repair. The new battery install failed, and now I need to buy a new ipod. I'm buying new this time and getting a warranty.",

            "title_review": "2015's Best Android Phone",
            "body": "Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own, specifically these \"edges.\" - finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. I LOVE my S6 Edge! When the Note Edge first came out, I thought that was the spiffiest thing ever. Not just that single edge on the screen, but also that lovely design and form factor - it was just a BEAUTIFUL phone. Now with the S6, I get twice the edge, in a smaller form factor that's a lot easier to handle and use. * The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges of the phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. And specifically, the S6 Edge is just the coolest-looking phone by far. The S6 regular might be the best functioning/overall phone right now, but to add another $100-130 to obtain something that is so unique and cool is a worthy sacrifice to me. The edges make the phone feel very angular in your hands, but I think it provides better grip, and you can get used to it very easily. Besides, most of us will cover it with a case anyways, so it should not be an issue. * The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2\" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, \"what the h3ll is this monstrosity??\"). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. * An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap nowadays. My S6 Edge goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * The missing microSD expansion issue is a legitimate concern, since everyone loves to store their music, videos/movies, and all their apps in their phones. Now, you have to be selective and choose what to include or not. But I also have a Samsung Tab Pro, so I put my videos and games in their, while my phone carries my music and apps. This situation is perfect for me when I travel, and would only be a deal-breaker for people who always want to hoard everything in their phone. * The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using the apps themselves) once you start installing more and more apps and put more and more shortcuts and widgets on the home screens. Worse, they would cram all their Samsung apps on you, which for the most part are inferior to their Google counterparts. They came preinstalled, and are un-installable - you can only downgrade and disable them, but you can't take them off completely. Now, with the new TouchWiz working in conjunction with Google 5.0 Lollipop, things are a lot smoother and faster. There are also fewer of those Samsung apps - now you have the option of downloading them, but they no longer come pre-installed and wasting your space, which is now more precious than ever. * Another \"con\" is that the S6 family is no longer IP67 water-proof/dust-proof like the S5 family anymore. That is quite a bummer as that was a huge relief for those times when we regret certain actions to our phones but could get away with it. Now, we have to go back to being extra careful. * Finally, the camera: It is great, what can I say? This area of technology will keep continuing to progress and advance for the next 5-10 years at least, but we have already came so far. I would go as far to say that besides dedicated DSLR cameras, you would not find better compact cameras like these for under $500 from a dedicated camera. And to have it be already included in your phone is quite amazing, when you really think about it. This year, it even includes optical image stabilization, which you can see actually working as you pan/tilt/shake the camera. I used to buy $300-500 super-zoom point-and-shoot cameras for my travels back in the days of 7-8 years ago, and they didn't come out half as good as what this camera can do. And there are built-in enhancements and edits that you can do straight from the camera that are quite robust and powerful. So, why did I say the evolution is near complete, and not yet? Well, besides the theoretical ideal that nothing is perfect, to the practical ideal like things like the camera continue to improve for the foreseeable future, I felt that while Samsung took some big strides forward, they also took some steps back. For instance, by making it non-plastic, they open themselves to being less experienced in sealing it up, so they couldn't make it waterproof anymore. In the same vein, they can no longer make the back plate removable to replace the battery(although it is not impossible - you can actually get around it, but then you would negate Samsung's warranty). And I'm guessing they didn't have enough research time in the metal production assembly good enough to include holes for the microSD slot. So what can they practically improve on to make this as near perfect as possible? Make it waterproof like before(or better), and if you can't make the back plate removable, then improve on the battery life, and allow for the microSD expansion slot. And keep improving on TouchWiz, and get the Google updates out quicker. Once those are set - and because we know you will always continue to improve on the processor(phone power and graphics power), the screen(resolution, image quality, color reproduction, brightness, sunlight legibility), and the camera, next year's edition should make it as near-perfect as possible for the S family, and maybe then after that you can start a whole new phone family, and bring out those bendable/roll-able screen technologies we know you're already working on, or something even more outrageous. So overall, while there are certain niggles which make this phone take a step back, there are enough advances to make this a true 5-star phone.",

It only changes third party apps into Trad. Chinese but for the initial apps like settings, phone, email... its still in English. Its also weird that there is a sticker stuck on the back of the phone which shows the model # and the IMEI. I am also unable find a ROM that can be replaced with this firmware. The reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it runs fine. With some tests from Antutu, it shows that the score is kinda similar to the score of an official S6. With all these issues, I conclude that this product MAY BE A REFURBISHED ONE!",

These vendors are buying defective batches from Samsung or somewhere and selling them as discounted NEW phones, knowing full well they are from a defective run. Samsung knows of this LCD screen problem but does not cover the repairs under manufacturer's warranty unless the seller provides an invoice with the IMEI or serial number listed as well as the date of purchase. These vendors do not list the specific IMEI number for these phones because they know full well they are from a defective batch that they have not refurbished.

New phone arrived next day. I had Best Buy upload everything as I watched. Then the problems began... First, the touch screen began doubling up on the letters Z, M & N. Then the phone would open multiple apps without my input (was it possessed maybe?). Then the piece de resistance -- THE VOLUME KEYS STOPPED WORKING!!!!!! Phone was only 2 months old!!! I was in LA on family business, being driven nuts by the loud ringtones that I couldn't lower without going to the Sounds setting to adjust, then I couldn't hear the ringer! Went to Samsung website to register phone & was unable to, as they said the phone was outside of warranty effective 12/18/18. Still trying to get something working, I scheduled a visit to the Samsung service center for repair. I arrived there this morning, only to be told the phone's IMEI has no warranty period left. So, what the seller listed as true is apparently not, and I'm out a chunk of change. Expensive lesson, given our fixed income & the fact I had to purchase a different phone (S10e) from Best Buy that will be more reliable. And it has a REAL WARRANTY!! So, save yourself some heartache & don't purchased \"new\" phones from the seller Vitalli or Amazon. They will not be new or under warranty. I will be contacting the seller for a full refund.",

They said phone was unrepeatable and has non-samsung parts in it. The back glass came off with little to no effort. The adhesive holding the back glass down is not the adhesive that would have came from factory. There are two small areas of de-lamination in the back glass in the top middle and right corner. These marks look like access points from the back glass being pried off with a tool. The rear camera lens assembly was not adhered to the back glass as it should have been. Multiple screws holding down the plastic brackets are not OEM and were replaced at some point. The device has been tampered with by a Non-authorized Samsung facility which disqualifies the device for service through uBreakiFix.",

            "body": "First of all, I've bought several phones from Amazon (and Ebay) over the years, and its always been a crapshoot on whether its gonna work or not. I knew this going in this time, which is why I decided to find a BRAND NEW Galaxy S7 and pay the extra cost for a non-refurbished, non-used, non-returned unit. I simply wanted a good phone right out of the box to replace my wife's old Galaxy S5 that's seen better days. It was supposed to be a birthday present for her. Yeah, not gonna happen. Got the phone yesterday morning, opened it up, went to power it on and the phone wouldn't even turn on. Okay, battery must be fully depleted, let's throw it on the charger. After 10 minutes I get it to power up and go through the basic settings to make sure everything works. Got through the setup, all looks well, but battery its at 4% with it plugged in, better turn it back off and let it fully charge. At 7PM, almost 8 hours later, its sitting at 81% charge and will go no further. I leave it charging the rest of the night on the charger and wake up to the yellow triangle screen! Okay, let's start the phone and see if I can throw a battery testing app on there. WTF!!??!?! I can't get it to boot now? I go into factory reset menu, wipe data/factory reset phone, then do a full cache wipe, the reboot, I can now get back into the phone, but its just not acting right, and I know how an S7 works, I have mine sitting right here, working like a champ and able to charge in minutes, not hours. I'm assuming the battery has been sitting way too long without a charge, the phone was either accidentally turned on when it was boxed up, or it turned itself on sometime after its manufacture date. In any case, its being returned and I'll just start looking at local brick and mortar stores for another phone for the wife's birthday in 2 days. I think I'm finally done with buying phones on Amazon.",

            "body": "This has been the worst phone I've ever owned. First, shortly after buying it, the screen stopped working and went black. I was lucky that I was able to exchange for another one (which was probably refurbished as well). Within less than a year of using the new phone, the phone has slowed to a crawl to where it takes 20 seconds to open the maps, or camera, or internet browser, or any other app. I've tried everything like keeping performance mode on, uninstalling all apps, safe mode, reset, etc. Still having issues. I don't think there is a virus or anything goofy on my phone. I recently started playing more with my work iPhone and will probably switch to iPhone. It will take some time to get used to it but it is a lot faster and doesn't seem to have all the software issues that Android has. I also don't like how Android doesn't give you the choice to cancel an update, after so many times of prolonging it, it will not give you a choice but will force you to install. Apps are also updating like twice a week which says a lot about the quality and reputability of the original publisher(s). What are they always changing twice a week? Who knows what these changes are and what they are doing to your phone and privacy, it is not fair that they don't always release notes regularly on what was changed. I am a programmer myself, and I have become more and more against open source code because all it does is invites everyone to hack-up your code and make your phone buggy and slow. I can see why iPhone is a lot more stable since Apple controls all of the code installed on their hardware.",

A number of people who bought this phone from other sellers complained that it was not a \"NEW\" phone but a reconditioned/refurbished phone. This was not the case with my purchase. This phone is new in an unopened box with all the accessories. Prior to making the purchase I contacted this seller and asked if the phone was \"new\". This seller responded quickly to say it was \"new\" with all accessories. It pays to contact the seller of any item if there is some doubt or question prior to purchasing. This is my first smartphone. I grew up in the rotary phone era so I'm \"latest technology challenged\". The documents included were very basic and not very helpful. So I d/l the 174 page Samsung manual. Which got me started in setting up the phone and getting started in the right direction. After fully charging the phone I opened a Verizon account. What I should have expected was - this is a 2016 phone and does not have the latest Android version. So - there was 29 updates to get me current with the latest Android version for the Galaxy S7. Very time consuming but necessary. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and especially the great customer service provided by this seller. A new phone that works great at the lowest price anywhere.",

I can be in the middle of the call and it just drops when I am IN the Verizon store. And then it dropped a call when the VERIZON TECH was using it. And when you send texts sometimes it repeats the previous message..... messed up. I DON'T LIKE IT",

A few days after I started using it had issues of connectivity with my MetroPcs internet provider . MetroPcs tried a few times to fix the problem, but it persisted...and when they passed the ball over to Verizon, verizon said all the S7 galaxy had been unloacked and they can do anything more. Bottom line....although the phone is unlocked, it is not compatible with other service providers other than Verizon - its original host. As I didn't want to switch to Verizon because they are more expensive than Metro Pcs, the supposedly brand new phone ended up in one of my drawers wasting my three hundred and something dollars.",

            "body": "Disappointed by the quality. I expected better from Samsung and realized their warranty has A LOT TO DESIRE. Because of the fact that the charging cable broke and their response was \"TO GET ANOTHER CABLE...\" really? with less than a month old?? The next day I received the phone, I dropped it causing a minimal crack to the lower part of the screen. The phone works and there's no damage to the touchscreen, I'm afraid if it gets wet, water may slip in the \"crack\". SAMSUNG claims that will NOT repair damage that's not under warranty, but will not provide with a charging cable replacement either, nor they'll replace (even if you pay) to have the crystal replaced. They have no authorized service centers and they will not recommend anyone and, if it's not serviced by an authorized dealer, they'll void the warranty... So what they're saying is: Look! We messed up with the note, the refrigerators (and who knows what else) We'll take your money, get has much capital as we can and then, maybe later, MAY BE able to do something for you. On the meantime, keep on buying our products. And remember if you broke it, we won't fix it, but don't YOU DARE have fix by somebody else, because we'll void your \"warranty\" Sadly I realized I made a mistake by purchasing this phone because I THOUGHT Samsung was a good and reliable company and it just proved me WRONG. I had my friends HTC one phone screen replaced. It was not just the crystal, it was the screen itself too. (It got run over by a real tractor, not home's, lawnmower and HTC replaced it without a charge, YES!!! WITHOUT CHARGE. (only once)",

            "title_review": "King of Android phones, a comparison between the Galaxy S6 Edge and the Galaxy S7 Edge",
            "body": "*Update 8-10-16* I wanted to write a quick update on my review to let everyone know how this phone has performed over the past few months. I still could not be happier with it, I am still surprised at how long the battery will last even with extreme usage. It has overheated a few times while using my Galaxy Gear VR but has performed much better than my old S6 Edge. The one complaint I have is that the screen got scratched from being placed underneath my pillow, it was very strange. I thought Gorilla glass had better scratch protection but I guess it still has room for improvement. I put a film screen protector over my phone so hopefully that will eliminate any future scratches on the screen. I would still recommend this phone over any other phone. In this review, I will be comparing the Galaxy S7 Edge to the Galaxy S6 Edge. When the Galaxy S6 came out last year, it was one of the most unique phones on the market. The dual curved display was something to behold, even though it was mainly good for the \u201cwaterfall\u201d scrolling effect and coolness factor. It had and still has excellent hardware inside and the 5.1\u201d screen fits in almost every type of hand. A year later we have the Galaxy S7 Edge, which comes with a bigger screen, bigger battery and better hardware. Samsung upgraded almost every part of their new phone and addressed the main short comings of the Galaxy S6 Edge (more on that below) I have had the Galaxy S6 Edge for about a year and have had the Galaxy S7 Edge for a little over a week. I\u2019ve been playing with the S7 Edge nonstop. So far the experience is nearly perfect. I have encountered no stutters, no lag, no glitches, nothing. I downloaded a couple graphically intensive games and it ran all of them very well, even games made for the Gear VR. Navigating through the Touchwiz UI was surprisingly smooth, even smoother than the S6 Edge. I haven't been able to drain the battery past 20% in a day even after intense use throughout the day. To summarize the Galaxy S7 Edge quickly, it is the best phone I have ever owned or used. With the Galaxy S6 Edge, I liked almost everything about the phone. It has a gorgeous display, I love how the edges curve and the Touchwiz UI has features that use it, especially now that it has the Marshmallow update, it has almost all the software functionality as the Galaxy S7 Edge. The build quality of both phones is fantastic, Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back make them very nice to hold and look at. There are things about the Galaxy S6 Edge that I didn't like however. Not having expandable memory was tough for me because I only had the 32GB version so I constantly had to keep my eye on storage space and delete apps, movies and pictures. No waterproofing was a letdown just because it would have been nice not to worry if it got wet. Battery life was a disappointment as well, I would have to charge my phone in the middle of the day or anytime I could, just to keep it from hitting 0% before night time. I also loved using the Gear VR but couldn\u2019t do anything longer than 15 \u2013 20 minutes because the phone would overheat quickly even after tweaking every setting I could find. Lastly, the phone was too thin and light. I didn't think this could ever be a problem but without a case the phone just felt too thin in my hand, I always felt like I was going to drop it or it would slip out of my hand. These things aren't deal-breakers just minor annoyances. Then I saw the Galaxy S7 Edge at the Samsung unveiling event. I didn't go the event but I did watch it on my Gear VR so it felt like I was there. I was so happy to see everything they were changing in the S7 Edge, they literally fixed all my complaints about the S6 Edge. Samsung engineered an amazing phone when they built the S6 Edge, but the S7 Edge, in my opinion, is much better than the S6 Edge and definitely worth the upgrade. Pros for S7 Edge: -Very premium to hold. The changes here are a bigger footprint as the screen size was increased by almost half an inch. Yes, half an inch can make a huge difference (quote from wife, I\u2019m pretty sure she was talking about the phone). The glass is also beveled on the top and bottom which has a very nice feeling to it. The back is also beveled which makes holding the phone much more comfortable as the glass doesn\u2019t go straight into the metal side like the S6 Edge. -The display is the best out of any phone in the market at the moment. I can definitely tell Samsung upgraded the QHD display. The resolution is the same but the colors are so much more vibrant and the darks feel darker. This seems to make everything sharper and clearer, I was able to notice a difference when I held the S6 Edge and S7 Edge side by side. -Touchwiz UI is cleaner and better than ever. The whole UI seems fast and fluid, especially since it's running on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. My favorite software feature is the always on display, I use it all the time and it actually saves battery because I am not constantly turning on my phone to check if I have e-mails or text messages. -Great performance in Gear VR. I have never had the S7 Edge display a message that it is overheating and needs to stop and cool down. Samsung revamped the cooling system in the S7 Edge with a specifically engineered heat pipe. I can attest that it works wonderfully. Everything I have done on the phone has been butter smooth and it doesn't get very hot to the touch like my S6 Edge would. -Very fast to charge. Much like the S6 Edge, the Quick Charge 2.0 is great at filling up your battery quickly. Especially when your battery charges from the 0% - 50% range. It does charge a little slower after the battery percentage reaches 50% or 60%. -Camera is amazing. I could write a whole book on the camera. Basically it focuses faster than any other phone or stand-alone camera I have seen. I am by no means a camera expert but Samsung did an excellent job on this upgrade. The picture quality in low light is better than the S6 Edge for sure. Pictures taken in regular lighting conditions look pretty much the same to me however. There were so many times I would try to focus and take a picture in low light but would miss the moment because the picture was blurry or the moment passed because the picture wasn\u2019t taken in time. I haven\u2019t had that problem with the S7 Edge yet, it\u2019s FAST. -IP68 waterproofing. I love that the S7 Edge is waterproof and doesn\u2019t have port covers like the S5 did. I don\u2019t worry about water damage on this phone. -Micro SD storage. This is a big one for me, you can buy a fast 64GB micro SD card on Amazon for dirt cheap. I bought a SanDisk Ultra 64GB and installed it in my phone, I don't notice any slowdown when accessing my pictures and videos. Now I have so much space and can always upgrade my micro SD card if I need more. Cons for S7 Edge: -Price. The Galaxy S7 Edge is expensive right now, and rightfully so. It\u2019s a premium device and if you want to own one, you will pay a premium for it. -Edge Screen sensitivity. Sometimes when I'm using the phone with one hand, part of my palm will touch the right side of the phone and click things I don't want. I heard a patch was being pushed out to fix this issue but this is the Verizon version and I haven\u2019t received it yet (4-18-16). All in all, the Galaxy S7 Edge is definitely worth the upgrade from the Galaxy S6 Edge in my opinion. Samsung took all the minor annoyances about the S6 Edge and improved upon them or added much needed/desired features. I would recommend anybody to upgrade to this phone whether you are using an iPhone, different Android device, or a Windows phone.",

            "title_review": "The Seller Makes the Difference",
            "body": "Last Monday night, I broke my Galaxy S7. I dropped it and damaged the LCD (note that the glass was completely intact). I thought there was a purple smudge on the left side of the screen, but it turned out to be the beginning of the \"bleed out\" and by morning, the screen was completely covered and I was unable to use the phone because I couldn't see anything. I did some research on line and found that the only remedy was to replace the screen, which could cost upward of $200.00. Since I had purchased the phone earlier this year from Amazon new for roughly $350.00, I found that spending $200+ on a repair made no sense so I ordered a new phone from the same company I purchased my original from, Re-Cell. I had no issues with the original purchase. It was brand new, factory sealed in a Samsung box with all original parts- charger, ear buds, USB cable. When the new phone came on Wednesday (2 days after being ordered), it was brand new, factory sealed in a Samsung box with all original parts- charger, ear buds, USB cable. When I activated the phone, most of my info transferred over through Google's backup, I would just have to figure out how to determine what was missing from my other phone and load it onto the new S7. While configuring the phone, I noticed that it wouldn't connect to WiFi. Not only wouldn't it connect, it wasn't even recognizing available networks. I looked the problem up on line, tried a few suggested remedies - none of which worked. It was getting late, I was frustrated and figured I would send an email to the seller through Amazon and see what happens. This was roughly 10:30 PM, Eastern Wednesday night. The next day, Thursday, I was at work and I had a response from the seller's rep named Eric. He apologized, said the company would make it right and had already arranged for a replacement to be sent and a return label issued for the defective phone. He indicated that the replacement phone would be sent out priority and I should have it in about 2 days. Well, sure enough, the phone arrived on Saturday as expected. I transferred the info from the defective phone to the new new phone via Smart Switch and the phone works perfectly fine. I couldn't be happier. I have to stress that it's not often enough that someone take the time to give a positive review, but in this case, I felt it necessary. Re-Cell's response was immediate - less than 12 hours after sending my email to them, they responded and already had made arrangements to correct the problem. That is simply OUTSTANDING! That is how you provide great customer service - no arguing, no haggling, no nonsense. Just \"we apologize, your replacement is coming\". Period. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy this product to purchase it from Re-Cell simply for the peace of mind that they know how to provide excellent customer service.",

I was on the highway, but the phone GPS showed me on a side street. It was giving me directions to get back on the highway from the side streets. I looked online for help. I tried rebooting the phone, I verified that all system patches were up to date, and all apps were updated. I used a GPS test app, and it showed that my GPS accuracy was only within 1100 feet! That's not usable. I read other reviews that other people are having similar GPS problems, so I'll be returning this phone, and looking for a different model.",

I tried using it a few days to give it \"the benefit of the doubt\" in case the battery indicator was somehow just incorrect, but it would last as long as you would expect at, say 50% charged. Also, this is not the first verizon phone I've had and I use wifi for everything at home so I know I get good service there. This phone would constantly drop calls, the people I called could never hear me either because of static or some other sound issue. Seems like buying a phone from this vendor is a bit of a gamble.

Then went to sleep without using it and woke up again aroun 9.30 and it was 78% !! If i keep browsing around 1 percent each minute will drain. So one hour and 50 % drained! I cant recommend this model. Even thoough they say it must work for 8 hours and more than hundredrs on standby which mine doesnt get close to! Update 1 december I applied for return due to bad battery and they refunded me back instantly! So all above said, i must APPRECIATE their refund policy. As the cellphone is still in a box awaiting ups pickup for return . Which they already failed to come ! Thanks edge cellular.",

            "body": "I returned this phone after 3 days. I was an early Android user (MyTouch) and switched to iPhone in 2012. iPhones have their own issues, especially with batteries, so I thought it would be fun to try out something totally new. I've been hearing so much praise for the Samsungs so I got a gold S7. I will say that I loved the feel and look of it. That's all I loved though. Here are the worst things about it: 1. The battery drained shockingly quick. At the end of the day I was at 15%. For a brand new phone that's really bad. 2. The phone comes packed with bloatware that cannot be removed. 3. The Android operating system is truly awful. There were so many weird quirks, bugs, and missing features. For example, there wasn't a restricted access mode so you can have your kids watch a video and not mess with the screen...but there's an app for one. Or the sound produced by the Samsung headphones is so bad I actually thought they were broken. They're not...but there's an app to \"fix\" that. Are you freaking kidding me?! Even seemingly little things caused a ton of inconvenience. My phone connected to my car's stereo via Bluetooth, but I was not able to use the car's controls. I had to actually pick up and unlock the phone to change a song. To Spotify it's probably just a little bug that they'll get around to fixing whenever, but to me it's a big deal. And I realized that if I kept this phone I'd better settle in for many of these situations, because the truth is developers don't care about Android and its apps will always be given lowest priority. And I'm not about to accept that when I paid for a \"top of the line\" phone. Is this what passes for normal to longtime Android users? Was that my fatal mistake, switching to this OS with too-high expectations, like having full Bluetooth functionality, or sending text messages without an app crash? 4. The phone was always warm/hot. Even when I wasn't using it. I'd pick it up and it'd be suspiciously warm. Made me very nervous given Samsung's recent fire issues. So back this terrible phone went. It's too bad, I think the design is beautiful and I wanted it to work because Apple isn't super great either. But unless you're on a budget or a super advanced user ready to root your phone, iPhone it is.",

I regret not recording a video of this to post but in the moment I was so shocked/ disappointed. I was really told never to trust phones that r \"waterproof\" because even if u put it in water and it still works u can never tell what damage was done on d inside. I didn't want to believe that considering all the positive reviews on d s7 waterproof however after what happened the first time I put it in water I don't wanna try it again. This is disappointing because like everyone else I was looking forward to using my phone under water and so on. Ps.. I didn't leave the phone for more than a min in my clogged bathroom sink of water. It was really just a test and to me it failed cus right after I took it out of the water the phone started to do all kinda crazy things without me touching the screen. It works good now so that's how I know it was the water that caused the malfunction. Also idk if it's just my glass screen protector but it's hard to type on the phone with it on. B4 the protector it was easy to type however I believe the screen is still supposed to be sensitive enough to be used with ease with a glass protector on...i put the pointer speed on fast and its still difficult to type sometimes so idk (it was a tempered glass screen protector from amfilm). Other than that like i said the phone works fine and looks sexy.",

    "description": "iPhone 7 Plus dramatically improves the most important aspects of the iPhone experience. It introduces advanced new camera systems. The best performance and battery life ever in an iPhone. Immersive stereo speakers. The brightest, most colorful iPhone display. Splash and water resistance. And it looks every bit as powerful as it is. This is iPhone 7 Plus. The Home button on iPhone 7 Plus is an advanced solid-state button designed to be durable, responsive, and pressure sensitive. Working in tandem with the new Taptic Engine, it gives you precise tactile feedback as you press. And it's even customizable. iPhone 7 Plus doesn't have just one entirely new camera system - it has two. The same 12MP wide-angle camera that's on iPhone 7 works with a 12MP telephoto camera that can get even closer. That means you can get higher-quality zoom from farther away. With an all-new four-core design, the A10 Fusion chip's CPU has two high-performance cores and two high-efficiency cores. The high-performance cores can run at up to 2x the speed of iPhone 6, while the high-efficiency cores are capable of running at just one-fifth the power of the high-performance cores. That means you get the best performance and efficiency when you need it.",

            "body": "I never write reviews, NEVER, but this product definitely deserves one. My brother purchased this phone a few moths ago and it is amazing! I use it for all my social media pictures, profiles, etc. It loads everything EXTREMELY quick. The quality is the best I have ever seen! Apple really stepped up their game with this one. I thought not having a headphone jack would be an issue considering I am always listening to music, but the adapter that transfers music from the power port is great! I don't have to turn up my music nearly as loud as I used to. I would definitely recommend this phone and I don't even have one yet! I am planning on ordering one for myself that way I can stop using my brothers...lol",

            "body": "Apple keeps making more and more fragile products. The 7 Plus must be encased in a hard case with a screen protector. If this is not done from day one, the product will break. The screen will crack, the button will crack. The case will bend. It cannot be dropped from even six inches. It is a delicate piece of garbage. Apps work as expected. But Apple has become a different company since the death of Steve Jobs. This will be my last Apple product. If you own stock in this company consider selling. They are likely not going to continue to be an innovation leader.",

It has a long-lasting, removable battery and the camera app launches with a double-click of the home button. The Bad Its underpowered processor makes the photo-capture slow enough to miss action shots. The Bottom Line Light users will do fine with Samsung's entry-level Galaxy J3, but you'll want a higher-powered phone if you plan to keep it around for two years or more.",

I don't know if choosing the silver one made a difference. I am very disappointed and will avoid using Amazon for important purchases in the future. I'm sure the product is fine, as I have owned and been very satisfied with the Galaxy S3 mini, S4 mini, S6, and S7, I just wish I had received what I purchased.",

            "body": "This phone was in good cosmetic condition when it arrived. Not a single scratch. But I noticed that the battery seemed sub-par, but not enough to prove that it was problematic. Warranty was 3 months, so conveniently for the seller, it wasn't until about the 5-6 month mark when the battery started to show conclusively that it was having trouble holding charge: by that point, the phone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours, and it wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few minutes when the temperature got down to about 40F (which it didn't get cold enough to test until after the phone warranty was up). The refurb process apparently doesn't include any kind of battery testing. So if you think this is a good deal, add in a new battery to your budget before you decide. Update at the 7th month after purchase: Phone no longer runs for more than 20 minutes without freezing and rebooting itself. I tried factory reset, but it does the same thing even after a reset. This is a failure of the refurbishment process. I won't get any money back because the refurb warranty was only 3 months.",

            "body": "I did away with my iPhone 6 Plus in April of 2017 and have been trying out a couple different \"dumb\" phones since then (an original Nokia 3310 from the early 2000s, the Punkt MP01, and now the 105). I have to say that I like the Nokia 105 the most of any I have used. The call quality is okay all-in-all (this has a lot to do with being on the almost-defunct 2G network provided to T-Mobile by AT&T) and I can hear conversations rather well even while walking down a busy city street with sirens/honking/yelling people. While on a call, I can pick up a certain tinny/hollow \"echo\" of sorts that, while distracting at first, actually helps me hear people better. Other reviewers have been complaining of the texting being lackluster. The T9 works adequately I think and there's the option within the texting menu to switch languages (so stoked that French is included). While I appreciate that I can use this for texting moderately well, the point of having this phone for me is so that I text less. Thus the overall usability of this feature being a bit limited is the point for me. For a dumb phone with T9 (which is by its very nature harder to use than the interface of a smartphone), Nokia did an appreciable job. The battery life is wonderful since nothing on this phone makes me use it for more than calling or texting people. I have gone several days without charging while using it for many hour-long+ conversations and sporadic texting. It uses the universal micro-USB for charging. Should you be away from any source of power, a second battery can be had rather easily and changed by yourself.",

            "body": "Let's be clear here. This is not what I would even call a feature phone. This is a dumbphone, sometimes in every sense of the word. My 4 star rating is not to be compared to the best phone in the world, but to other \"feature\" or \"dumb\" phones. People purchasing this should be expecting to only receive phone calls and text messages (TEXT MESSAGES, NOT GIFS, IMAGES, ETC.) There is no browser, no camera, no bluetooth, no SD card expansion, no mp3 player (there is radio if headphones are connected). Let's review those features. This phone works on GSM networks: so only T-Mobile, or one of the MVNOs that use their towers. This phone only supports 2G and there is some concern as to how much longer carriers will support it. AT&T stopped their 2G services at the beginning of 2017. For being a phone...it does pretty well. You can save contacts to either the phone or the sim card. The contacts are presented as an alphabetical list. Using T-mobile towers (US Mobile to be exact) the phone quality is ok. Remember that this isn't capable of using HD Voice or compatible technology as that requires LTE. For text messaging....this is where is lacks. While I'm comfortable with using a numpad for typing texts, it requires too many extra key presses just to send a message. Example: you receive a text, you go through the menu to text messages, click to read text...there is no reply button. Instead you have to click Opt, then reply, then type reply, and then when you want to send...it asks you to confirm the number you are sending the message to. A small thing but instead of 2 clicks it is 5....for every reply....think about that. All in all I like the phone as it gets the job done with minimal cost and distraction. It can be good to do a detox from your smartphone, good as a backup phone for emergencies (30 day stand-by with 15 hour talk time!), good as a first phone for young kids, etc. I would say this is NOT a good phone for seniors unless they have decent vision, finger dexterity, and are pretty good with technology already. This is a small phone (a plus in my opinion) with small buttons and somewhat small font on a 1.8\" screen.",

            "body": "Look, I\u2019m not gonna pretend this is some amazing phone that you must buy but it does exactly what it says it does. I purchased it for a friend in a transitional home. During treatment they are not allowed camera phons or phones with internet access. Do you realize how hard those are to find these days?! I found this one and one being sold for well over $100. No thanks. I\u2019ll try this one. It works on the old 2G network so I hooked it up with MetroPCS by T-Mobil. It\u2019s not locked like others have stated, they probably just tried using it on a network like AT&T that doesn\u2019t support 2G anymore. I believe t-mobile/metroPCS might be the only major company that still has the 2G network but I could be wrong. Maybe other pay as you go companies use it as well. It does have a flashlight feature along with a radio that picks up local stations if you hook up some headphones and a bunch of old school games like Snake. You cannot send or receive picture messages or emojis. It\u2019s a throwback phone to before technology took off. If you\u2019re looking for a phone without internet and camera, this is your guy. Or if you\u2019re just in need of a super cheap throw away Trak phone. It serves its purpose. It is fairly small so texting with fat fingers in the old t-9 text style might be a pain in the ass if you\u2019re a big texter but we did it back in the day, you can get used to it and do it now.",

Its got about 3 or 4 games on there including Tetris. The one great feature I love about this phone is it does not break easily. I have dropped it a few dozen times. The most severe damage to date is the back cover pops off. I now have the huge inconvenience of putting it back on. It rarely has some signal problem where the calls cut out a little but I;m not 100% sure its my phone. Signal strength is great with my provider.",

The quality was good on first impression, and the clicky buttons felt responsive. I did not like the arrow pad very much, though. The directions felt vague when I pressed them. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to using the phone daily. But unfortunately, in Wilmington, Delaware, most 2G cell towers have been switched off. I thought this phone might support 3G networks, but it does not. So, I had to deduct two stars. I have returned it to Amazon, which went fine.",

I would have liked some buttons on the side of the case like volume/flashlight. It does have a flashlight which is pretty cool but you have to be at the main menu to use it, so a button on the side would be nice for it. Only one background to choose , which is okay I guess. The price here is $36 but I got mine for $40. And there\u2019s a lot better used phones out there for $40. Idk what carrier it can use in the USA because I\u2019m in Afghanistan, so if you\u2019re deploying then I\u2019d get a phone before you come over if you\u2019re gonna get one, because the internet sucks here. It is really comfortable to hold but it\u2019s not long enough and my thumb gets cramped trying to press the small buttons. But it does call and text. To see your own phone number you gotta look at the SIM card \u201capp\u201d at the main menu, and choose balance .",

            "body": "This is a great cheap smartphone for under $100. Sure it is not very good in the spec department but depending on what you are looking for it might be the right choice. As mentioned earlier the specs are nothing special. It is definitely the weakest part of this phone. From personal experience the performance feels like on par with a Samsung Galaxy S5 or an iPhone 5s. If you are someone who always gets the latest phone, you will be disappointed. I'll highlight a couple positive things that this phone does well. This phone is perfect for someone who doesn't use any demanding apps. Forget about most games. Don't worry though because calls, texts, email, and chatting work perfectly. I see it as the best communication device under $100. I'm using this device as a back up/travel phone. I currently have an AT&T and a T-Mobile SIM in the dual slots. The phone can switch between them on the fly. You can route calls and data between the two SIMs automatically or manually choose it each time you place a call. Most dual SIM phones I've used don't handle it this seamlessly or they make you switch one line off before switching to the other one. The status bar shows the signal strength of each line and also the type of connection (LTE, 4G, 3G, etc...). Keep in mind that each frequency of the radio can only be used once. This means if the 4G connection for each SIM you have uses the same frequency, then SIM #1 will get the priority and #2 will fall back to the next available. The Nokia 2 really shines in the dual SIM functionality. The processor used in this phone is the snapdragon 212. It does not use much power since it is not very high performing. This combined with the huge battery (4000mAh) means you really do get great battery life. I have the brightness set to the max, wifi and bt on, two SIMs, after a day of use (7am-7pm) I still have 75% battery left. This is on track to get me two days of standby, you could probably stretch it if you power down over night or go into battery saver modes. One neutral point of this phone is the storage space. It is only 8GB with about half of that available after the OS is considered, since it has expandable storage I didn't make this a negative. A microSD card is a must with this phone. Get a decent SD card and combine it with the internal storage. The phone isn't that fast so you won't really notice much performance difference between launching apps off the internal memory vs the sd card. Don't get this phone to play games, fly your drone, or for the camera. Get this if you need the connectivity of dual SIMs and the long battery life. EDIT: I also forgot to mention that Nokia has promised continued support for Android 8 and 9 for their new phones that were released this year, the Nokia 2 was included in this announcement as well.",

The Nokia only comes with 8GB of memory, before I put any apps on it I noticed it had about 4.3GB of space left. I added a micro SD card even though I only put a couple of apps in the phone. It takes better looking pictures than my iPhone SE. The battery does last days on Standby, I would say about 4 days. Due to the low price it doesn't have some upscale features such as a metal back or the latest battery charging connector, still at $99 you are getting a lot of bang for your buck. I'm tempted to get a Nokia phone as a replacement for my iPhone but I really do prefer iOS over Android. Too bad you can't get iOS on Nokia.",

            "body": "I'm generally impressed with the value for money for the Nokia 2. However, I recently discovered that the Nokia 2 is not fully compatible with all T-mobile 4G LTE networks. According to Nokia Customer Service the Nokia 2 TA-1035 model operates on the following bands and frequencies: WCDMA: Band 1, 2, 5, 8; LTE: Band 1 (2100), 3 (1800), 5 (850), 7 (2600), 8 (900), 20 (800), 28 (700), 38 (2600), 40 (2300) This means that the TA-1035 DOES NOT work on LTE Bands: 2 (1900) & 12 (700). You need those bands to use T-Mobile's 4G LTE service in many places. So, this phone is not fully compatible with T-Mobile. Unfortunately, I have not yet found a reliable way to check which 4G LTE bands T-mobile uses for specific areas. So, if you plan on using T-mobile, and don't want your service dropping as you travel across the US, you had better not get this phone.",

This Nokia 2 is by far the best one yet for signal strength and connectivity, WiFi calling and MMS/SMS messaging over WiFi (a must have for me). Usually a T-Mobile APN or Ultra Mobile APN (the owner of Mint Sim) will work, this time - the Ultra Mobile APN worked perfectly on the Nokia 2. I'm a big fan of stock android with the monthly updates and no bloat (it's identical to a Pixel, without fingerprint or pricetag). I think it's a great deal at $98, I did add a 64G SD card and formatted it for system use for extra performance. The phone does lag as you add more apps. The rear camera is blurry. My cheek while talking on the phone puts people on hold and activates speakerphone sometimes. Apps can act a little strange at times. Looking forward to release of the Nokia 6 (2018), 7 plus and 8 Sirrocco in the US. I bought this phone as a test run for their newer products. Connectivity is the best ever.",

            "body": "Update 2: I wish I could give it negative stars for terrible customer service. Update: it's worse than I thought. The loudspeaker quality is absolutely horrible. It's probably the worst I've ever had on any phone. The speaker is a muffles piece of junk, and somehow the OS produces a very noisy output. It's loaded up with unnecessary 3rd-party background apps, even though it doesn't look like it at first. It is not just stock android. Perhaps to try to make up for the small memory, it kills EVERYTHING you are not using. Even if it's a tiny app (like a 100k display filter), or if you have plenty of free ram, this phone likes to kill stuff. Even with a small browser with only text enabled (images and scripts turned off), this phone won't allow it to remain open with even one tab if you switch to another app and back. It doesn't have a smart memory manager, it just hates everything whether you have plenty of memory open or not. This really ruins Android. It's not stock, AND it doesn't like your apps. If you use a memory card, apparently it will sometimes lost track of it when you reboot and have to be removed and replaced. Thanks! I have had Androids with LOWER specs which work better than this. Bonus annoyance: The startup sounds can't be turned off, and it also make noise when you plug in a charger. Strangely, one things which does seem to work well on this phone is wifi hotspotting. I get a faster connection to this with my Chromebook than it did with previous phones. Tip: For some reason, when you insert your SIM T-Mobile sends the wrong APN settings. If you are only getting 3G, try manually changing your APN settings (wireless & networks - more > Cellular Networks > Access Point Names). Switch it to the one which has \"fast\" in the URL if it isn't already, and/or if necessary open whichever APN is selected and change the \"APN protocol\" to include IPv6. I don't know what that means, but that is the setting T-Mobile's FAQ says to use even though the automated update sets it to IPv4.",

It is a slow phone but as a phone for my senior dad who only knows how to call and read a photo text, use google voice search, and maybe another 5-10 apps max this is a great phone. It's loud, vibrate function is strong, screen is bright and clear enough, it's lightweight, and the battery last closer to those old school GSM phones (2-3 days!). And best part is no worries if dad drops and breaks it, the price point is almost disposable and it gives dad assurance that he's not going to lose $500 if he break/drop something like he did with his old iPhone.",

            "body": "Before i took the plastic wrap off or even turned it on, i was very impressed by the weight and feel of the Nokia 2. Weighing in at 162 grams, she's got some Gravity in her! It feels good. I bought this phone because; I have owned two Windows Nokia Lumia's. before, and both were excellent! (The Nokia 2 being no exception =D) The advertised battery capacity. A \"Pure\" android operating system. Nokia delivered just that and more! The build quality and feel is beautiful. I bought a white model, and the two tone black metal bezel to the white body is very smooth. The screen, for a 720x1280 res @ 296 Display PPI, looks very good. Nokia states that this is an energy efficient screen. It looks good compared to a Samsung. The performance of the phone is slow. Not fast. Again, Nokia stated that this is an energy efficient CPU. I am a very demanding performance enthusiast! I like fast cars, and Fast computers! That said, i am not disappointed by the phones performance at all. It is a quality Snapdragon CPU, so i am sure it will churn through many tasks very steadily. Using this as a daily driver, along with a more powerful tablet, might be a good strategy to consider for power users. Just saying. I am writing this review about 24 hours after the unboxing, and it is above half battery life since initial charge. And i leaned on the camera and downloaded, installed and configured almost 100 apps. I will be pushing this phone. It accepted a 128gb micro sd card. So, mem is not an issue with the initial 8gb and the Clean and Bloatware Free Android Os allows you to control where you store what. Device could very easily be bootloader unlocked and flashed, if that's your thing. I might try Lineage os at some time, but i see no reason as this is one of the cleanest Android OS's i've ridden so far. Camera doesn't seem to be on par with previous Nokia's with the Carl Zeiss Tessar lens. No problem, its still a great value. And i have yet to get a feel for it. TBD. . . I think this is a great product and just want to shout out to the engineers who put the Nokia 2 on the shelf, you guys are all right in my book.",

Then you gotta reopen the app and play it again. 3) apps have to constantly relaunch. Say you are on YouTube but you get a text message. When you look at the text and then go back to YouTube, it restarts. The video you were watching is started from the beginning again. 4) want to leave a comment on a YouTube video? This phone makes it impossible. It always errors out 5) like to post videos on Instagram? Good luck. This phone makes it real difficult to trim and edit videos. Not sure if it's even possible.",

            "body": "I use somewhat high end phones, and I bought this as a temporary phone when my primary one (oneplus 5 broke - dropped it big time). As soon as I did the initial setup and connected to wifi, a whole lot of updates got installed (maybe about 6-8 of them), one after the other, requiring a reboot every time. Was a pain, but I would rather have too many updates than not have anything at all. Great thing also is that the OS is mostly clutter-free, and very few trash application in there. Initial problem I had (I have since moved on to an S9 when I got one on a deal, and this is truly a back up phone) is that it is slow. I haven't used very many phones this cheap, but I am a fairly light user. I dont game or run benchmarks 3 times a day. The only reason I buy more expensive phones is better camera (and not the fastest processor or huge RAM or tonnes of storage). Even with that light usage, I thought this phone was slow. I can get by with it, to be sure, but the sacrifice is clear. It also has very little internal storage - that 8GB runs out quick. I started installing my apps, and about 10-15 apps in (none of them a game), it told me to remove something else before I can install another one :( One thing I have to give it though - the call quality is FANTASTIC. People often used to say my voice is breaking up with my oneplus5, but with this Nokia it never happened. And I could feel the difference myself. Battery lasts quite a bit. I think you can probably go 2 days, especially because you wont be doing much more than talk, given the overall (lack of) responsiveness.",

Also, strangely enough gmail app on this phone reports I have 9,999+ unread emails but gmail on my old phone doesn't do that. With an epic delay in getting notifications, it's really hard to tell why the unread count is so high. The hardware is really pretty though, and nice to hold. Also call quality is good, and my parents found dual-sim attractive as they travel and don't want to carry two phones. But I won't recommend this to them either, because the phone is just so sluggish. It's not worth it.

According to the reviews here everyone either loves or hates this phone, which made it difficult for me to decide if it was right for me. It turns out to be perfect but I'm using it as a 2nd phone for travel; it would NOT work as my primary phone. The difficulty with this phone is insufficient memory and storage space, as others have pointed out. Today it was running slowly and I tried to send a picture via MMS and it failed. Turns out I'm running out of storage already. I was able to uninstall some apps and move others to the SD card to get it working well again, but I still have less than 1GB to spare. Everything else about this phone is better than I expected for what I paid ($100) and it's so nice to never have to worry about the battery dying! This review is for the TA-1035-B. I notice earlier versions are selling for even cheaper but I can't vouch for those. BTW if you have a little extra to spend, my primary phone is a Moto G5 Plus which I found for only $150 and is a nice upgrade in every way from my previous phone which cost almost $1000! (Galaxy S6) There's just no reason to spend that much for a phone any more.",

            "body": "I purchased this for my wife to replace a Nokia Lumia 521. She uses it primarily for phone and text, and taking pictures. It is a perfectly adequate device for her needs (and is reviewed in that context). Coming from the unsupported Windows Phone ecosystem, it was also a nice perk to install a few home automation apps on the new phone. This device will not win any awards for speed, but in this case, that isn't an issue. It calls, it texts, it takes pictures. Switching between apps is a little slow, but not annoyingly so. It is pretty much stock Android (as of this review, it is running Android 7.1.1, 8.1 is in beta for the device but I won't subject my spouse to beta testing). The build quality of the device is top notch. It feels more like a mid-range device than a budget handset (especially compared to the old Lumia 521). The screen is clear and sharp. I added a basic case and screen protector to the phone just in case. Storage is definitely a compromise. After installing updates, about 3 GB of 8 GB were still free. If you want to install apps or take pictures, you'll want a microSD card. Fortunately we had one from her old phone, so that wasn't any extra cost at this time. Overall, this is a solid budget device, and I definitely recommend it. Pros: -Low cost -Stock Android -Receives Android updates -Good build quality -Decent battery life -Nice screen Cons (this is a budget device and these are definitely not dealbreakers): -A little slow -Low storage",

If you know how to taper down background data exchanges/apps you can get it to run reasonably well - but it still lags and certainly won't multi-task well. The reality is I could not discern more than 890 MB of RAM (yes, LESS than 1 GB) - looks to me like they rounded up. So - IMO it's a flawed device and I ended up returning it. I was initially drawn to it because I'm frequently navigating in cities/places I'm unfamiliar with and it's got a GREAT GPS chipset - GPS/AGPS/GLONASS - this thing sees all of them \u2013 but as many other reviewers here have stated, it\u2019s just too underpowered to run apps with any fluidity.

The camera is not good either, when I take a picture, I have to wait a while to take another picture, camera's speed reaction is bad.

            "body": "For $100.00 in 2018, I think this is the budget phone to beat. Let me emphasize, this is a entry level smartphone, but the build quality is great. I have a OnePlus 5 myself and was very surprised how well the Nokia 2 compared when I unboxed it. I bought two of these for my parents at Christmas and they've had no issues with them running on T-Mobile. My daughter's hand-me-down Nexus 5 recently tanked and I just can't see spending much more than this on a phone for a teen. To me, excellent battery life and continued updates is more important than a little extra ram or faster processor. I considered the Amazon Moto e4 or e4 Plus, but those are towards the end of their life cycle and are never going to see Android 8.0. The Nokia 2 is at least slated to receive 8.1. Pros: - Cost - Great screen picture (no its not AMOLED etc... but were talking $100 phone here) - Very good call quality on T-Mobile, have yet to setup daughters phone on AT&T but will update once done - Large batttery - Dual Sim - Expandable Memory - Vanilla Android, not heavily skinned - Update to at least Android 8.1 Cons: - Sluggish Performance - Built in 8gb memory is over 1/2 gone as soon as you start up the phone - OK camera",

I have read that some people have sound quality issues but mine is fine. Now the bad points. The system uses almost all of the memory so one or two apps is about all you can install. The processor is frustratingly slow. From the home screen, click on an icon and you can count off seven or eight seconds before it opens. Texting? It takes the same time for the keyboard to activate...and sometimes it drops out of sight while you are typing...and you have to wait the eight seconds all over again. So...basically the phone is only good for making calls and non urgent texts. Its basically a flip phone without being a flip phone lol.",

            "body": "Don't buy this. Seriously. You will regret it just like I currently am regretting owning this phone. Allow me to explain. The phone has less than 900 Mb of memory. This means it has difficulty running many apps with higher requirements. I literally can't download some regular apps that shouldn't be an issue for a phone, because those apps require a gig of RAM. 1 gig of RAM is not some hefty amount at this day and age. This phone cannot run multiple apps at the same time without 1 or more app crashing completely. Want to use spotify while you also have maps going on a drive? Nope, the phone closes 1 or the other because it can't handle both apps at once. Want to have maps running in the background? Nope, not with this phone. If you exit out and let it go in the background, it simply closes your map and directions. Want to show a friend something on youtube or send a snap with a cute filter to your significant other? HAHA! Joke's on you nerd! This phone takes a laughably long amount of time to even LOAD snapchat or youtube, and many times half way through a video or through applying some filter/sending a snap it will simply crash the application. This phone is infuriating. I honestly have to fight the urge to throw it across the room into a wall every day. The only upside to this phone is the low price tag, but the low price tag makes sense when you realize you are paying for a piece of trash phone that should be sold for 50 dollars, not even 100. Don't buy this phone. I'm furious with it, and it's only been a few weeks new out of the box.",

I've arranged for a replacement via Amazon, and I'll update/edit this review upon receiving/testing the replacement phone. EDIT: Kudos to Amazon for a speedy, painless job of replacing the phone... Unfortunately, the audio quality when using bluetooth is still Crappy as F***.

For a budget phone costing this price, you get what you pay for. The battery size is also a nice addition. If you watch a lot of youtube videos or other streaming sites you will have a lot of time to watch videos. The battery life is quite impressive. I also think the build quality of the phone is nice and professional. This phone also has cameras that will suffice in any circumstance. They are not the best cameras but you will be able to clearly see whatever you take a photo of. There is also a flash on the back which can double as a flashlight. For the $100 price point and under there are few phones that can come close to this value.",

I cannot play a single song via Bluetooth without it skipping. It might as well not even have a camera because by the time you get it open, whatever you were trying to photograph left. On the bright side, it'll go three days without charging. I'm not sure if thats a function of an awesome battery or that I just got too fed up with using the thing. Don't buy this.",

Switched from a Nokia windows phone that I stuck with too long, but was hesitant to switch because the battery lasted 8 or ten days, See so many people who's phone won't last a day and didn't want to be hostage to a charging ball and chain. Pleased to say this battery life is just as good, maybe better. My usage habits are leaving Bluetooth on as it links to both car and home phone. Leave the location on to keep the phone unlocked at home. Wi fi and data as needed. Average day maybe three calls and eight or ten texts, but I get a solid eight days on a charge. Happy with that. AT&T doesn't advertise it but this can be used as a go phone for about $8 a month or as a back up, and easy to switch in and out of full plans, just log in to you account. Main thing that forced a switch is our summer house has spotty cellular service and this does Wi-Fi calling that old phones didn't. It may be that this gets better cell reception and won't need that, but the Wi-Fi calling works great. Can't say enough about how this fits my needs for under a hundred bucks.",

            "body": "I ordered this phone for my little sister as a gift for her birthday. She is becoming of age and felt it was time to be able to have a personal way to communicate with the family. Although she is surrounded by iPhones and Samsung devices, she is in love with this phone! The phone arrived in a nice small box. The box contains a charging block, micro USB, and even a pair of headphones with a mic! Even though the phone has a nice sturdy premium feel to it, it does have its ups and downs. Pros- The phone feels nice in the hands. Apparently, it weighs about 161 grams. It also has a 5in display with gorilla glass 3 that I think goes up to 720p resolution, Which is not bad considering this phone cost sub 100$. Another great thing is that this phone is receiving all of the latest software updates and security patches. It is going to be supported for at least 2 years so you cant go wrong with that. The phone has all necessary bands for the use in the USA and also contains all wifi bands. The last pro that I can remember is the HUGE battery it has at 4100 mAh. This thing can last you about 2 days. Cons- A big let down is the Snapdragon 212 they have this thing running on. If you are a speed user ( I have a Pixel and a Galaxy S7) then don't consider this phone as a daily driver. Instead, it is the type of phone you take with you on your travels or as a backup. But in my case, My sister is patient and understands that her first car isn't going to be a Ferrari. It is perfect for calls and texts, surfs things on google with ease and can handle a game or two but don't plan on having things running in the back too long since it only has 1gb of RAM. The camera on this phone is also just ok but also again for my situation it is perfect. She isn't going to be posting on social media or taking pics of the grand canyon. Instead, she'll use it to take pics of the cats and dogs etc. The storage is also pretty small at 8gb but can be expanded since it has an sd card slot. So to recap, This phone is great for 100$. Do get it if you're going to gift it to your grandma, mom, sister or anybody who has never had a smartphone before. Also if you need a backup or travel phone this phone is great for that too. Do not get this if you're used to the speed of the newer flagships as you'll find yourself getting upset over the small lag that seems to be an eternity. Anyway good luck!",

As in, you try to play music (with the default Google Play Music app) and send a text, half the time the music app quits when you do so. 100% of the time it quits when you try to take a photo. It is a worthless piece of junk. The music app will also just quit on its own probably once an hour or so from I guess running out of RAM?! I was hoping to try out Android on a cheap phone to see if it had gotten to a place where I could switch from iOS which has its own growing annoyances, but this phone runs so much worse than my 4 year old iPhone that I can't hardly believe it.

For this Nokia 2, it is not the case although I had long wait for Nokia back to market over 2 years. For hardware, I would say it is okay. However, Android system seems having issue. As other reviewer mentioned, I experienced it rebooted by itself yesterday whole day! After spending few hours, I needed to uninstalled some apps and reinstalled again MANY TIMES to make it worked again. I hope the OS new update can solve this problem. Happy Nokia is back but not so happy about Nokia 2 performance. :(",

            "body": "This phone is absolutely terrible. I was able to get it started okay but the first time I tried to make a call the screen went black and the call appeared to have not gone thru. I was just stuck with a black, blank screen. I didn't know what to do I just couldn't believe it! So, I pressed the on/off button a couple if tine and just shut the phone off completely to restart it. I was given no option to get back to the call, I didn't know what to do? Meanwhile, on the other end my call had gone thru! The person I was calling was on the other end saying.... hello, hello, hello, and wondering what was going on! Not cool when your calling your boss, not cool at all! This happened twice, and in my first two phone calls and that was enough for me. Because of the trouble I was having I set it aside for a couple of weeks and then decided I was just going to return it. But, I was unable to get it back within the 30 days so I decided I might as well keep it and try to work with it. Now I can't get it to work at all (it's been kind 4 months) because with the time passing and not using it I forgot my password! Of course I've been online doing little tricks to get past this and learn how to reboot it and start it from factory conditions and all that but nothing works! I have started the process successfully and it will look like its going to work but nothing ever works in the end. I just can't get any further with it. Now it's telling me I have to use my Google account i started with but when I try to put it in it doesn't take my information. So I am stuck in this perpetual mode of that blue screen and trying to get it activated and it's driving me mad! I've tried everything. Well, maybe not everything but the thing I am being asked to do to get thru the google lassoed, I have no idea how to go about and I'm just at my wits end with this. It's been over 4 months now and I haven't been as to get it to work almost the entire time. I will try to fix it again I suppose when I have the time and patience but wtf! This is such a pain. I've wasted so many hours on soo many hours nights trying to fix this and I still can't get the stupid thing to work! AT ALL! It just won't let me last this initial blue screen. I can't get past this stupid google account thing. Damn google! This is so frustrating! I have wasted my money and now my time trying to fix this and get this phone to work. It's been a nightmare. I wish I could just get my money back, I haven't even used it! But, they say no returns after 30 days. It doesn't make sense when they're selling a faulty product! And frankly it's not not fair and not right, nor is it fair or right on the part of Google either, I never asked to sign up with Google. I was forced to.",

            "body": "The Nokia 2 is by far the cheapest Android phone one can get with timely Android security updates every month. The next closest is probably the Nokia 3, but the Nokia 3 is not available with a US warranty. The Moto E4 and Moto E4 Plus, which may be the prominent competitors to the Nokia 2, do not receive security updates monthly. I would never buy either of them. The Moto X4, which is part of the Android One program and therefore receives security patches monthly, was intended partly to provide a cheaper alternative to Google Pixel models with Project Fi. However, \"cheaper\" still means a price tag of around $300 at the very least for the Moto X4. I suspect and hope there's a sizable niche of people like me, who are dying for an Android phone that receives timely security updates every month and who don't want to pay for a Pixel or Moto X4 or an Android Blackberry (not super inexpensive and from what I can tell not always super timely with monthly security patches). As a result, I was very excited about the Nokia 2's prompt availability in the US. However, I was sorely disappointed to find out that the phone I received, which shipped out on December 7, only had the September 1, 2017 security patch. It didn't even have the September 5, 2017 security patch, which patched a critical WiFi vulnerability, one that would allow the attacker to take over the phone just by being within WiFi range when WiFi was turned on for the phone. I can't believe it. The Nokia 2 was publicly announced on October 31, 2017. Surely, it should have shipped with at least the September 5, 2017 patch, if not the October 1 or October 5 patches. This is complacent and irresponsible. I haven't tried yet, but I doubt I will be allowed to update over cellular, which means that when I try over WiFi to get the WiFi patch released in the September 5, 2017 update, I'll be exposing myself to the WiFi attack. While I may have higher security requirements than most people, this is reason enough for me to be returning the phone. All the complaints about security aside, the Nokia 2 is a very decent phone. It looks very elegant, in a subdued and minimalistic way. Sitting next to my iPhones (5s, 6, and 10), the Nokia 2 looked more aesthetically pleasing than the much more expensive iPhones. As for what might not be immediately apparent unless seen in person, there are several things worth pointing out. First, the pewter doesn't look grayish as it does in the photos on the Amazon product page. Instead, in person, it looks brownish (picture brown leather shoes or a brown leather belt), but very dark brownish. Although not my very most preferred look, it looks very nice and leans towards conveying masculine. Second, it is not a lightweight phone. According to one website, it weighs 5.68 oz (161 g), whereas, for reference, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s weigh 5.04 oz (143 g) and 3.95 oz (112 g), respectively. Third, the battery life is amazing. It can sit for days (on airplane mode) without battery life dropping more than a couple percentage points or so. Initially, I hated the weight of the phone, but now I think the extra weight but might be a worthwhile tradeoff for the massive battery life.",

It even has two SIM slots which is useful for frequent travelers. The areas where Nokia appears to have cheaped out are with the weak processor and limited memory - the phone is noticeably pokey; apps judder and lag and notification sounds are often broken up. Installing an SD card will certainly help with capacity, though that won't have much impact on speed. Overall considering the price of this phone and the quality software and build, the so-so performance isn\u2019t really a big deal since basic functions like email, browsing, calling etc. all work fine.",

            "body": "Used Nokia phones for years in the late 90's and through 2007 - until the iPhone came out. Sadly, Nokia is a shadow of what it use to be and this phone proves it. I broke my Google Pixel a few weeks ago and picked this up locally as a replacement phone. What a painful experience. For starters the model with 1.1ghz of RAM simply just isn't enough to run this phone. It's far to slow. Opening apps can take up to 5-10 seconds and apps tend to close between switching which makes it a pain. It's simply too slow unless you're just doing voice and text with the occasional app usage. On the ROM side, 8 GB just doesn't cut it anymore. With the Android OS now taking well over 4GB, you end up with less than half the drive space for apps, photos and content. That's just not enough. Clearly, this phone was designed for low end, entry level users but it doesn't even do this well. Often apps crash or simply don't work well. My advice is if you're going low end, by a 2nd hand phone insead. Though this phone looks good and has a solid construction and good battery life, it simply lacks the power and space to be even a decent device.",

            "body": "This is a phone with a weird set of features and components. It has a chassis made from a single piece of aluminum, a Corning Gorilla glass screen and a big honking 4,100 mah battery. Parts that would be found on higher end smartphones, but also has a slowish Snapdragon 210 processor, 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM. The user can add an SD card and Nougat can format the card so that it can act as an expansion on the paltry internal storage. I have a 64GB SD card on this phone which expands the 8GB into approx 70GB. But not all Android apps are designed to run off the SD card. The starting 8GB would be standard on a smartphone from five years ago. The phone comes with Android Nougat out of the box and Nokia says that it will get Oreo 8.1 when it passes muster. It also has dual SIM capability which is good for travelers. The Android experience is almost pure. Only a few items like a Nokia support app and FM radio are added extras. The screen is pretty good. It is a bit laggy as a phone with the low amount of RAM, the low end CPU and internal storage would have. I ran a Geekbench 4 benchmark on this phone and it did not fare well. The Nokia 2 fell below the least powerful phone in the benchmark, The Nexus 5. A phone that's been obsolete for almost three years. So for those who are into speeds and feeds and are looking for the newest and fastest, this phone is a dog. Battery life is very good. I've had the phone on for close to 24 hours with average usage and mostly the stock apps installed, only about 10 apps of my choosing installed and it's at 77%. I have yet to run the battery down to zero. If you are looking for an entry level smartphone for a low price for a child or a first time or light phone user who's not going to push this phone's capabilities to the edge, the Nokia 2 is a servicable device. Pros- 1. Quality build. 2. Low Price 3. 4,100mah battery = excellent battery life. 4. Nice camera and screen. 5. Nougat out of the box with Oreo coming. 6. Mostly pure Android experience. Cons- 1. Slow CPU and laggy performance 2. Only 8GB internal storage (can be expanded with SD card.) 3. 1GB RAM.",

(function \"Do not disturb\"-\"Automatic rules\") - The phone suggests me if the missing call number is likely a scam that is saving me time to look it up in internet - If I missed a call and somebody left a message for me, now I can see the playable track on the display and can stop, pause or start the voice mail at any point of its length which helps me tremendously in understanding of all important information I had a chat with Nokia representative and he told me that Nokia 2 is a quad-band GSM phone.",

            "body": "UPDATE May 15 2018 --I woke up this morning but my Nokia 2 did not -- after being a loyal customer, I won't buy Nokia smartphones again unless they are able to get back to their roots of affordable and DURABLE smartphones (see my original review below). I can't stress how light my use of my Nokia 2 was since I bought it at Christmas to use as a secondary phone -- barely at all, and not often even carried around. I've never had a Nokia totally brick before, but this one is bricked. It won't power on. I can only imagine some issue with the integrated battery.. Repair shops won't touch this phone. Meanwhile my Nokia / Microsoft Lumia from 2014 keeps hammering on, and the battery is easily replaced if there is ever an issue. As my Nokia 2 is dead after minimal use and just out-of-warranty, I just bought a Moto G5 Plus (also a sealed battery phone) from a retail big box today as my Android device. Out-of-the-box, the Moto G5 Plus operates light years ahead of the Nokia 2, including MUCH better call quality. If you are looking at the Nokia 2, I would recommend going with the Moto G5 Plus that is nearly identical in size to the Nokia 2 and can be found for under $160 new currently outside of Amazon. *** I'm going to hang onto it through the holidays to see if it improves but my first impressions aren't great. The sound quality on calls does not seem to be as good as past Nokias I've owned -- including Lumias and an XpressMusic. It has started to randomly reboot a few days out of the box, which I never experienced with any previous Nokia I've owned. I am by no means putting my new phone through any paces but I'm concerned that the Nokia 2 does not seem to be very good as a phone or very stable as a smart device. The screen is better than other phones I've owned and the battery life is impressive. We'll see if it somehow smooths out and improves operations but it has already cost me a work call. I suspect there are other happy and frugal Nokia customers looking at this phone but I can't give it a strong recommendation... yet.",

            "body": "Opening the Nokia 2 was fun. I came from a galaxy s7 that I lost but couldn\u2019t afford to replace. So I suppose I am comparing it to what I had before. The Nokia 2 design and first impression is amazing. Powering on the phone was quick to boot up. The battery came with 83% charge. The OS was extremely clean free of bloatware. Literally not even Nokia bloatware. All google software. Setting up was a breeze I have a gmail account. Everything was downloaded photos, old apps, contacts etc. took about 20 mins for my photos and such to come in (several hundred). I ran a game that would sometimes freeze up my old iPhone 5s and rarely my Samsung S7 called \u201cClash of Clans\u201d. Just to stress the processor. Surprisingly the game loaded but not as quickly as in the S7 (yes I understand the Nokia has an entry level processor) the game played well. No freezing however under a heavy base attacks frames started to slow but not to where I would be frustrated. Next I tested the network speed on my carriers T-Mobile and ATT (personal and business). The Nokia 2 connects fine with both networks when I had the respect SIM card in. 25mps LTE band 12 on T-Mobile and 31 mps on band 4 on ATT. Phone calls are crystal clear and volume is robust however speaker phone and video watching the volume was a tad low for me through the single speaker. Battery life. 3 fulls days of use and game playing before I finally start to charge it. Battery life is the best I have ever had from a phone. I would assume the slower processor saves battery life. The only time the phone gets warm is on a charge. Overall this phone is a winner of your remember to close apps after using thing instead of letting them pile up likewise with browsers tabs. My daughter complained the phone was slow on loading videos for YouTube. Upon looking at the phone I noticed she had 13 YouTube videos loading at the same time on different chrome tabs. After I close all except the tab she was viewing the video zapped right in and started playing. Memory. This is where I deducted one star. After all of my google photos and apps finally downloaded along with a few required updates the phone had 2.1gb left out of 8gb. So adding an SD memory card is a no brained if you choose this device. It will take a 256gb SD Card. Well hope I informative enough Cheers!",

            "body": "I am in love with the battery and I love that the phone lasts for more than a day maybe even 2 or 3! I like the heaviness of it and the curves. It's perfect! I just didn't like the operating system which is Android, since it's my first time coming from a Windows phone. I had to look up online for a bunch of hacks since a lot of what the Andriod system was doing is slowing the phone and making it lag unnecessarily. I'm not used to waiting a second or two just for the text screen to pop up. The camera is ok. Don't zoom. It sucks and use the editing system to correct the colors. Also that \"Beautify\" option on the camera will make selfies look gorgeous. A micro SD card is required. I don't use a lot of apps but they do update a lot and ironically the Android operating system already takes a chunk of the 8GB. Half of it actually. One of the problems I've run into is receiving pictures. I wasn't receiving them. It had a lot more to do with T-mobile than the phone. I just restarted it or tried to look for a better signal. I'm not sure about games. I don't have any on it but I don't think it's capable of gaming. The most usage I have gotten out of the phone is for emails, social media, reading, youtube, surfing the net, and GPS navigation. That's my everyday use and it lasts for more than a day. There are ways to make it last longer and to fix the system and it's all online. Plus it also helps that the phone is built well. I dropped it accidentally without a case and it only had a few scratches but nothing falling off or broken.",

There seems to be no way of actually talking to a person. I first attempted the chat function with them and that was worthless. They asked my issue and responded after about 10 minutes. Going back and forth was terrible with someone who obviously did not understand that I do not need a repair, only a part for the phone. I then emailed them and again, there is no way to buy a back cover. Completely useless. I WILL NEVER buy Nokia junk again.",

After transferring all my information that I needed to the new phone my memory was full mind you I have a additional storage card. Oh yeah the speed of the phone was like dial-up if you don't know what dial-up is just sit there for 5 minutes and do nothing because just accessing a message or anything on the phone would take forever! The look and quality of the phone felt really good and it looked really nice but other than that it is a piece of garbage! This was my second try at buying a phone from Amazon I'm going to stick to the traditional method of getting a phone because it wasn't worth it!",

Not very useful if were going some place and relying on directions. The phone had a big problem with podcasts and music shutting off after a few minutes. Infuriating. The delay between switching apps was intolerable. That's because the N2 has just 1GByte of ddr. But with 8.2 Oreo, this RAM-lacking phone became much, much more usable. Navigating while playing music worked as it should. The audio shut-off bug was gone. Many other things got much better too. This phone gets 5 stars not because it's the best phone out there, but because for $90 it's a phenomenal value. With 8.2 there are still times it lags in a frustrating way. But for $90, you get PURE ANDROID and a really well made piece of hardware.",

For navigation, the voice prompts and map refresh was mostly late - but it did work even though if I relied on it totally, I would need to reroute several times to actually get to where I was going. Again, for the absolute basics such as talking, texting, and the occasional photo, the phone works fine. For less than twice the cost going with an asian phone provides more than three times the benefit. If all you need is a phone for the basics, this phone looks nice and works well for that purpose.",

I've had it take pictures and not save them either if you can believe that. And periodically it will lock up the zoom and exposure, then tie up the camera interfaces and the only way to fix it is to power cycle the phone be. Let's talk music. Every music app that I have tried inevitably crashes on this device. No reason, no warning, no consistency. Just stops playing and that's that. When it is playing it's not very loud either. Something I noticed is that some times taking a picture makes the music app stop. No idea why. This can be a great phone for travel because you load it up with maps and try to navigate and maps inexplicably stops and you find yourself wandering aimlessly around a town/country you've never been in before. There is no performance. I knew that going in but this is an all time low. You can do one thing at a time with see heavy lag, or you can try multitasking until everything you were doing just crashes or quits. The touch screen is very, very inaccurate as well. I got this to travel with because of the dual SIM functionality and that it does alright. But that's about it. Do yourself a favour and pick anything other than this.",

            "body": "Based on the value of this phone, I give it a solid five stars. It obviously doesn't have the most powerful processor, but it runs Android 7.1 quite smoothly, if not as speedily as phones with better specs. I've heard complaints that it lags, but it's not enough to bother me in the slightest. My only previous experience with Android is with a couple of small tablets over the years (Nexus and Amazon Fire), and this thing runs circles around those. Even with the cost of adding a Micro SD card, it's a huge bargain. I replaced my aging Windows 10 phone with this Nokia, added the Microsoft launcher, a 64GB memory card, and a few apps that I need, and I'm ready to roll. The fact that it's Nokia was a huge selling point for me. Even though the phones are made by HMD Global, I'm sure Nokia wouldn't put their name on crap. When you pick it up, you can just tell that it's well made. It feels solid in the hand, with just enough heft. And from what I've read, Nokia will be rolling out Android updates as they're available, unlike a lot of other manufacturers. Full disclosure: I'm on my second unit of this phone, the first one wouldn't recognize the SD card I had installed. The seller replaced it with zero hassle, and this one doesn't have that issue.",

Facebook Instagram Pandora all work really well on it. It might be little to slow for intensive gaming but that is nothing I'll do. I'm running it on T-Mobile and it even supports WiFi calling for it under the WiFi setting and it works perfectly. Great little phone!!!",

            "body": "This was bought for my son. He was initially enthusiastic about the phone. The performance was so much better than his old LG. But in the last couple of weeks he has run into issues that are not insignificant. First off when charging this phone overnight it will shut itself down to the point that the power button alone will not turn it back on. It is necessary to use the power-volume up combo to get it to power back on. The first time that happened almost resulted in this phone being returned. Now it is constantly rebooting. Several times a day, in a seemingly random fashion. He has looked but can't find a firmware upgrade. This is terribly frustrating as it happens in the middle of doing things with the phone. What if he were on an emergency 911 call and this happened? So I am afraid that this phone will most likely be going back. It is a shame because we both thought that this would be a decent phone with Nokia's name on it. One day later...asked to return this unit. The above mentioned problems were bad enough. This morning the phone had lost all the accounts that had been stored on it. It came up looking like it had been set to factory refresh. That is it. I am through. Will try an ASUS.",

I did another experiment, I turned on the torch light LED and left it burning for a good 10 minutes and the battery did not budge even 1 percent. The screen is large and detailed with great color and contrast. The gesture swiping is fast and responsive. The memory at 8GB is sufficient to get started, and likely enough for the average user. I added a class 10 Samsung MicroSD card, the latest and fastest and upgraded the storage to 128GB. The camera is 8MP and is nothing exceptional, but I did not buy the camera for pro level pics or movie making. I am very pleased with this phone after 2 months of use and would HIGHLY recommend the Nokia 2. I'm still blown away at the cool factor and speed and perks for a phone that cost about 100 bucks.",

Every time I hit a key it registers about 2 seconds later. I will update this review when I upgrade the phone to Android Oreo in May 2018 when it comes out to see if this improves the phones performance but as of right now the performance is horrible. Also, the audio performance is worse than my 2012 Galaxy Note II and I don't believe that can be fixed with a software update. Definitely not enough power even when hooked up to my Anker 20W Bluetooth speaker.",

This is a phone for someone very young or someone much older, or someone who doesn't care for being so high tech.

            "title_review": "Upgraded From Nexus 6P",
            "body": "Going to compare this to Google's other phone, the Nexus 6P since it's been my daily driver before owning this phone* and describe the Pixel 2 from that perspective Decided to switch over since I miss owning a 5inch phone and the battery life on the 6P is not as good as it used to be. First thing I like to say is that there is no night-and-day difference between these two phones. The Pixel 2 has better functionality in most cases, but the Nexus 6P still hold up really well as is not outdated whatsoever. Last week, the 6P had its Android Oreo over-the-air software update. Well read on if you're on the fence. *Skipped out on Pixel 1 since it didn't have front facing speakers --Battery Life Pixel 2 wins this hands down, even better than the 6P when I got it out of the box at launch. Can last up to 1.5 to 2 days if you're conservative. Example: Typical 8 hour work day +1 hour commute (half hour to and from work) + 30min lunch break During commute non stop music. 80% volume Lunch 20-25mins on Youtube 15min breaks: some light mobile gaming, Two 2-3 minute phone calls Check e-mail text and notifications throughout the day Doing all of this. Starting from 100%, dropped down to 48% by the end of the day Super fast charging with included charger. Very similar to the Moto X Pure, but the batter life is way longer. Takes about an hour and a half to fully charge your phone from 10% --Camera Better stabilization/auto focus The auto focus on the 6P is horrible, even if you tap on the screen it will not focus accurately. On the Pixel 2 it auto focuses on an object for you without having to touch the screen and does a decent job at it too. 6P does a better job at capturing true real life colors especially in scenery. Pixel 2 makes everything more vibrant and seems like it auto photo-shops everything (which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference). Pixel 2 has way better front facing camera. Excellent for selfies as it auto blurs the background and do automatic lighting touch ups on your face. Video works way better as there's less camera shake when playing back Did a blind camera test with phones I have available**, borrowed from friends/family and the Pixel 2 had better quality picture hands down. **Nexus 6p, iphone7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Note 4, Moto x pure, Amazon Fire Phone. Note that I don't have access to all high end phones such as iphone X, Note 8, HTC U11, LGV30 along others. --Finger Print Sensor Both very similar. Didn't notice a difference. Was able to detect 100% of the time with dry/clean fingers --Visual aesthetic, build quality Don't know about some people, but I love the camera visor hump on the 6P. Makes it look very futuristic and stands out from other phones. The Pixel 2 on the other hand, looks very generic and plain. The Pixel 2 does not have a streamline look like iphone x or Galaxy edge series as the screen not edge-to-edge. It has large bezels on the top and bottom which i don't really mind since I'm not accustomed to bezel-less screens, but i can see how some people are if they're used to it. Having bezels does have it's advantages as it's great for mobile games where you have to hold your phone horizontally Pixel 2 is also very lightweight. Even lighter than the Nexus 5 and feels very fragile. This is the only phone i bought a case for a week after purchase. Pixel 2 is dust and water resistant. Great for traveling, if you're an extrovert, or an adventurer with no arrows to the knee I don't like the side buttons. For the 6P the power button has this cross hatch metal texture design to it making it easily distinguishable from the volume rocker. For the Pixel 2, all the buttons feels the same, so it takes some time to get a feel for it Personal preference, but i like the 5inch display rather than the 6inch (thus one of my main reason for switching). 6inch is better for viewing cinematic movies/videos, but I already own a laptop and tablet and those tend to do a better job. I find a 5inch phone more portable and less finger travel when using --UI Android Oreo is very smooth. You will not notice a difference from the 6P with Android Oreo unless you compare them side by side. Pixel 2 is slightly faster, but only by milliseconds. Most of it probably have to do with finger travel from larger screen --Front facing speakers At first i assumed it would be muffled compared to the 6P due to the water and dust resistance, but it's surprisingly better than the 6P at higher volumes. At around 80% + volume there's much less distortion on the Pixel 2. Not to say that the 6P is bad, but once you hear the sound quality at near max volume from the Pixel 2 it's hard to go back. No headphone jack on the Pixel 2. So you have to resort to bluetooth for personalized music. This can be troublesome if you are an audiophile especially if you already own a expensive wired headset But if you are a true audiophile, and can afford it, i would get a dedicated mp3 player. Namely the Sony Walkmen brand It does come with a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in box -Software update New android software first on Pixel 2 for 3 years instead of 2. 6P still have updates as mentioned before it updated to Andriod 8.0 last week I also own the Nexus 5 (phone released in 2013) and it still receives security updates from Google, but it stopped getting major software updates (stopped at Android 6.0.1) probably due to hardware limitations. Pixel 2 like other Google phones has no bloatware like ones you see on Samsung phones as is pure android -Active Edge At first i thought it was a throw away feature, but I find it quite useful overtime In the beginning i just used it to set alarms, but after a while starting using it for the Android Assistant. It's very similar to pressing on the google search bar, but much faster. Note that if your phone is off and you use the squeeze feature,you are automatically prompted to the lock screen. Exception being you have no passcode, you have trusted locations or trusted bluetooth devices active. Trusted faces also work, but it takes a second extra for it to boot up. When the phone is on, it's very intuitive, as it's easier to ask the assistant anything from directions and reminders on the fly. You can also squeeze to silence phone calls instead of pressing the volume rocker if you see a spam or phone number of a person you don't' have to talk to at the moment --Google Lens Google lens is similar to Amazon Firefly (on the Amazon phone that no one uses?). It's better at picking up words, number and text than objects -Always on Display/ \"Now Playing\" Out of the box, the Pixel 2 has an always on display showing the time/date, and app icon notification. You can go to settings and turn this off if you want to save battery life. If you have it off, you can easily access it by double tapping on the screen. Always on display is great when you're sleeping and as you can glace over to look if you have it on a smartphone stand on the nightstand Pixel 2 has a \"Now Playing\" feature which auto detects music playing in the background with is great as you don't have to ask google assistant for it or use a 3rd party app like Sound Hound. Song has to play in background for 10-20secs in most cases before it's able to display on your phone depending on how loud, clear and popular the song is. --Transfer Process Easy to transfer data use included adapter. If you own an android phone, all apps will transfer over, you just need to re-enter some passwords if it's not connected directly to your google account. You can also transfer iphone data over but it's only contacts, and photos ----Overall a good upgrade if you like the enhanced features. 6P is still a good phone and is not outdated in terms of software and hardware. If you find the upgraded/new features on the Pixel 2 enticing then it's a good upgrade. If you have any questions, please put in the comments.",

At first the phone was phenomenal and the battery lasted more than a day with normal use - I was able to get almost a day and a half on a single charge. My husband has had a Pixel 2 for over a year and he hasn't had a single problem with battery capacity and loves his phone. This phone was obviously exposed to heavy use or something before it was re-sold. I understand that this is a used product, but I didn't expect the battery capacity to be so terrible so quickly.",

            "body": "As someone who is happily locked into the Apple ecosystem (iPhone, iMac, iPad, MacBook) I knew nothing about the Android phones until I started doing research. I purchased the Pixel 2 specifically for its great camera \u2014 single lens, with optical stabilization and amazing \"night sight\" setting. The Pixel 2 launched at about the same time as the iPhone 8 (also with a great camera & video setting) but currently can be purchased for roughly half the cost of an iPhone 8! So for me, it really came down to cost. Photos are amazingly sharp/detailed and \"night sight\" is truly incredible. Like all single lens cameras, the digital zoom is to be avoided, but I already knew that. Video is good, not great but I don't shoot much video so it isn't an issue for me. If you're looking for great features and a great camera, the Pixel 2 offers these at a tremendous value.",

Also, unlimited Google drive back up till 2020. Awesome. My only recommendation is, don't ever buy the newest Google phone. It takes Google about a year or two after release to \"finish\" a product. I am two versions behind, which is about perfect to my taste. I need my phone to work correctly 100% of the time. This phone does. I gave it about 3 months before writing this review.

            "body": "I purchased a used version of the pixel 2 after having some bad luck with a refurbished original pixel. I can say that it was a great decision in that I saved hundreds of dollars and got a unit in excellent condition. The pixel 2 is a great smartphone and made numerous improvements over the original pixel. The cameras are my favorite part of this phone, they take amazing photos and I can't believe how professional the photos look when implementing portrait mode. They look like something straight out of a magazine. Low light environments still result in some graininess but the low light feature does help. Processing performance is impressive, I rarely see the system chug and I can carry out plenty of multitasking. The front facing speakers don't offer the cleanest sound but as someone who used to accidentally cover the speaker on the bottom of the original pixel I am a huge fan of the new speaker locations. The display is fine and I like the options to choose how much color saturation you desire. Active edge is a cool feature but I don't find myself using it very often. It requires a good deal of force to activate and it often requires squeezes in multiple places to finally trigger the assistant. One of my gripes with this phone is that it is no longer compatible with Anyview Cast on my Hisense smart TV so I'll probably need to purchase a chromecast in the future if I want to do things such as screen mirroring to my 4k tv. I've read that it also no longer supports Miracast. The battery life is great and I always have plenty of battery left over at the end of the day with moderate usage. The fingerprint reader is super fast and located on the back of the device. The fingerprint is located in a place the feels very natural for my pointer finger to rest on. This is a great phone with a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone looking to replace their original pixel or older android smartphones.",

Selecting any of these options simply returns back to the same exact screen. All of this would be fine as the product page says it comes with a US warranty, and this looks to be just a lemon, which does happen with technology and tends to be the purpose of these warranties. Unfortunately, the seller claims this warranty is through Google, and Google only has warranties for authorized resellers, which I have been informed that this seller is not. I will continue to reach out until this has been resolved, and am hopeful an exchange/refund is possible, as I would not have bought a phone with no warranty and just being out $550+ is no fun.",

Android Q is updated into it now and is working great. The camera is so awesome. Takes great pictures and video. Only downfall I see is no headphone jack and no SD card slot although with one of those fancy adapters which are cheap that can plug into your charging USB-C port, you can use them for 3.5mm headphones on one end and either OTG memory or charging on the other side. Then you're all set. With 64 gigs. And 400 apps my memory is still over 50% free though anyways and I can't see myself needing many more apps. For $210.00 USD was a great deal and although it was a used unit there wasn't a single sign of use noticeable and the battery is still holding an awesome charge. Came with a long charge cable and adapter for 110v. Great buy and I recommend the seller. Shipping was on time (2days) and was across an international border so was very satisfactory. Thanks to the supplier and Amazon for this great buy!!",

Google assistant is SO good and helpful. I love the ok google feature. Googles native apps are amazing as well..the google travel/trip is perfect for how often we travel. Connect it to my e-mail where I get all my confirmations and BAM itineraries are organized and everything is easy to access. The size is perfect for me, not too big and not too small. I love the finger print on the back instead of the the bottom front. The live backgrounds are just neat. Overall I love the android system and the camera on this thing is super awesome. I am a full time photographer and it really is handy to have around instead of carrying around all my other gear for personal use. would buy again and again. Battery life has been excellent I love the \"now playing\" feature on my lock screen instead of having to shazam music all the time. Backups to google drive are seamless and I never run out of storage. Highly recommend!",

The camera on the phone no longer functions properly. 95% of the time when I open the camera, it states that it has encountered a \"fatal flaw.\" After multiple restarts, the camera will usually work for about 5 minutes again before encountering this fatal flaw again. Google customer support is criminally unhelpful. 3 separate times they promised to get back in touch with me by calling me \"in an hour\" or responding to an email. They never responded or reached back out. In my email chain to customer support, they told me to call Verizon, then refused to respond to other communications. Additionally, their customer service representatives are not aware of their warranty policies. On multiple occasions I read their own warranty to them, as the representatives were not aware of certain clauses.",

            "body": "I have a pixel 2 phone that is less than a year old, under warranty, and in perfect condition. It started to have charging issues and eventually it stopped charging entirely. The problem is not the charger or the mechanics of the connector: my spouse has an identical phone, so it's easy to test the charging equipment and the connector is completely clean. Google \"diagnosed\" it over a web chat (all their service is from overseas, from my experience) and offered me an \"advanced replacement\", which amounts to them sending me a new phone, after which I send this one back. The problem is that any replacement process involves a web page that doesn't work. It has been 4 days since my phone died, and they still have not even started a replacement process: they send me a web link, I click on the web link, and I get a message \"It's not you, it's us. We're working on fixing the problem. Check back soon.\" Any calls or chats to the company involve repeated requests from their representatives not to worry: they're working on it. No escalation path is provided, no alternative solutions; if you can't get their link to work, you don't move ahead, and their link doesn't work. Any self-respecting vendor would just send me another phone, but this dystopian giant demands that everyone follow the yellow brick road that leads to a precipice. No wonder people hate google! This is how outsize companies eventually end up being broken up. Edit: It's been a month since I wrote this review, and I've recovered from most of the frustration... Here's how it went: after 7 days, google sorted out it's webpage error, and I was able to return my first phone. Of course, I had to buy a cheap phone in the meantime, to the the tune of about $100. They promptly sent me a second phone (which you have to sign for at home, so have it sent to your place of work!). After about a week, I noticed the front-facing camera didn't work, so I went through the required hour of chat conversation and returned it. The second phone worked otherwise, so it wasn't that big a deal. The third phone arrived, and by this time I am really good at re-installing apps and backups, and this time I actually have the second phone to do it from, so it wasn't too bad. I went on vacation to Paris, and bingo, the third phone dies with a message: \"Slot unbeatable: Load Error\". This is the kiss of death. The phone is now a brick. When I get back from Paris next week, I'll start the return process yet again. Since I now have so much experience with the chat help, I can say that it's not bad (I correct my earlier statement disparaging the chat support), but the phone hardware is apparently garbage (in my experience), so my recommendation is DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM GOOGLE. And by the way, each time you do one of these returns, they put a $600 hold on your credit card. I have yet to see how that all works out!",

I\u2019ve been wanting to switch from Apple for ages and I thought I\u2019d go ahead and try for the the Pixel. I really liked the phone! It was sleek and nice and I liked that the fingerprint unlock was on the back and less awkward to reach. I think it\u2019s a great phone to switch over to, but I wasn\u2019t quite as ready as I thought I was to switch, so I sent it back. The phone arrived sooner than the estimated date - very pleasant surprise - and the phone came very secure in the box with an adaptor and charging cable. I\u2019d recommend these guys for sure. TLDR Good, reliable, sent + arrived quickly, and as depicted, in good condition. A+",

Calls drop the bluetooth connection every 3 seconds (the call won't hang up, just goes to bluetooth limbo), and there's constant audio drop out to stream music. It actually makes for a very unsafe experience because you have to fiddle with your phone constantly instead of paying attention to the road. I've told Google about this about 4x and there's supposedly nothing they can do without engineers getting involved, which basically means they won't lift a finger to help. It's pretty ridiculous. And I'm not the only one, there's a whole forum of people having problems with this in their vehicles on Google's own forum where they still have been unresolved - just search for \"Bluetooth issues on Android 8.0 Oreo\" Do yourself a favor and get an iPhone instead. At least their phones are stable",

It's like a fog horn going off. Maybe this is only with the verizon text ap, but that is my preferred texting app. 2- squealing. perhaps if you don't have excellent hearing, this isn't a biggie. but since day one, there has been a terrible squeal in the background of phone conversations. not there on bluetooth, not there when listening to voicemails 3-texts dont send. sometimes the button to send out a text doesnt respond the first 5 or 6 times 4-the square button that gives you a scrolling window through all your open apps doesnt always work I really wanted to like this phone. I've never owned an apple product, I'm not looking for an excuse to go to mac. It's genuinely terrible in so many ways. I'm not a fan of the no headphone port.

            "title_review": "Awful! Worst purchase in years. ALL INTERFACES NON-STANDARD!! INCLUDING CHARGER!! And headphone. No written info, YouTube only.",
            "body": "This is the most disappointing technology purchase I have made in the last several years. And I haven't even had it up yet as a phone or camera. I am seriously debating taking the restock fee hit and returning it. Why? It has an UTTERLY non-standard interface, both for simple charging, and for audio! It has NO! standard headphones jack, nor any simple organizational method for creating a foldesr and putting your apps in them. At least, I can't see where it does. It also DOES NOT HAVE ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION!! NO MANUAL! And forget even an online manual --- all it has is a bunch of stupid, useless **non-searchable** YouTube UNCAPTIONED \"how do you what I think maybe someone somewhere - maybe - might want to do\" videos - and can I return to the NO standard audio interface? The charging cable is non-standard. Not only is the cable non-standard, but the WALL PLUG (AC/DC) adapter is NONSTANDARD. I can't even charge from the DC-DC (\"cigarette lighter\") adapter in my car. You will need to buy a special adapter for each and every outlet you want to use in your house. And a SEPARATE, SPECIAL CABLE for each cable you want to have. God forbid you ever travel with this phone: loose your adapter - OR EVEN YOUR CABLE - and you will not be using your phone again until you can get somewhere to receive special orders. Unlike the Apple non-standard adapters and cables, I've never seen either these \"special\" cables or their adapters for sale anywhere. And at least I can plug a non-standard Apple cable into a standard USB adapter. There is no jack for headphones. Or external (\"hard-patch\") output to any sound or other source that I can find. I did mention no manual - right? I can only assume Google thinks we all should carry \"blue-tooth bricks\" around with us... but who want to carry heavy blue-tooth headphones in their purse all the time?? Not to mention they are expensive and mine, at least, seem to fail routinely. VERY VERY EXPENSIVE!!!!! To get a headphone for home and one for work and one for the car (for the gym) I'll have an added $150+ expense I had not counted on. It may be that the absence of any manual is the worst thing. I was actually offended by the abysmal quality of the YouTube videos. If I'd wanted to be entertained I'd *go* to YouTube --- not try to get specific, simple \"how in fact can I --- or even can I?? -- make a folder to separate my Spanish from my English from my personal from my work-related apps?\" information. Not to mention simple things like the ... ok, does the only port you do have - the non-standard USB port - output to headphones? And where might I ever get such a thing?? REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD JOB!!!!! NOT something I would have expected from Google. (God forbid I ever actually encounter one of their cars!!!!!! It is NOT reassuring!!) -UPDATE- I found adapters for this weird interface on Amazon - I guess some very new other items use them too - but I stick with my original review. DO NOT travel with this phone - you will not find the cables and chargers. And there is NO MANUAL!!!",

            "body": "I've had android and iPhone before. There are pro/con's for both but I like Android better. That being said, this phone perfectly exemplifies what Android is supposed to be. Design: I miss the headphone jack. i use corded headphones regularly. That being said, I rarely use the headphone jack and charge the phone at the same time so using the USB-C to 3.5 mm audio adapter hasn't been an issue. An added plus of using the adapter is I no longer have to deal with certain headphone plugs not fitting due to my case not providing a big enough opening. I love that the speakers both face the front.I had adapted a way of holding other phones in a way so that my hand cupped the sound and directed it to my face. No longer needed. Otherwise, the phone is pretty standard as far as premium phones look. You'll likely use a case anyway this isn't really an issue. Performance: There is absolutely no lag in this phone. As soon as you touch a button or spot on the screen, its already where you need to be before the entire weight of your finger crashes down. You can snap photos one after the other and not face any dreaded processing hold screen. OK Google detection is much improved. Not sure if this is due to hardware or software, but I no longer have issues waking my phone up to tell it to create a reminder or something like that. Also, I haven't noticed it responding to others saying OK Google like my previous phone did, but I wasn't on Oreo yet so that could also be why. (but I can't rule out better microphone hardware that might be able to provide better signal to noise ratio) Finger print sensor is lightning fast. Haven't had too many issues with my fingerprint not reading although I did load the same finger twice to get better results. Battery life: With my previous Nexus 5x, if I used the phone (basic stuff like reading news, listening to music, and maybe watching a couple youtube videos/using the maps app) I could maybe make it half a day. With the Pixel 2 after a day of light use I still have 50% battery left. I could likely go 2 days of light use or 1 day of heavy (watching videos) use. Display: The display is absolutely beautiful. The new screen allows for individual pixels to be turned on or off which makes the blacks super dark as there's no backlight. I think this is also why the battery life is so awesome. As a plus, the time, date, temperature, and icons of notification types are able to be displayed on the phone at all times. This is awesome as it makes the phone a true nightstand clock replacement and you can even tell if you missed a text without touching your phone. Camera: Don't get me wrong, the camera is the best I've seen on a phone. But comparing to the Nexus 5x, you don't notice THAT much of a difference.However, with the performance, you can actually take pictures and not have the phone crash on you. Overall, I've been hearing talk of how the pixel 2 still isn't fully complete as in they're missing features, but I can't imagine how necessary they are. Definitely the best phone I've owned/played around with.",

My Nikon SLR broke, and this is a big deal for me, as I have an online jewelry store and photographing colored glass on white backgrounds give most cameras, or the camera operator, nervous breakdowns. On a lark, I borrowed my son's Google Pixel camera, and did some tests. Then I researched the Pixel line online, at photographer's and graphic artist's sites I trust. Based on the test pictures, I bought a Pixel 2. As a camera! I was able to speak directly on the phone with the seller, ask questions, and receive special assistance and answered questions. The customer service was so excellent, that it was clear that I was speaking to someone who understood the product and who could connect it to my needs. By the time the conversation was over, that phone was in my cart and the purchase completed. To my delight, this phone is so well designed, I find that I am going to be using it like everyone else on the planet is using their smartphones. Bought a camera, got a great phone in the bargain! Again, many thanks to this seller. If pictures are your thing, read up on the Pixel 2. It is amazing.",

What I really liked was how sleek and customizable they are - but it seems they've finally lost the battle of the smart phones. This Pixel 2 is actually an HTC phone so it was easy to pick it over the XL when I found out that LG made the XL and the new HTC 12U only came as an large format phone. What guy wants a phone he can't put in his pocket? It was so easy to copy everything over from my old HTC M9 and then to customize it. The only challenge is getting all new cables for charging it - but at least these USB C 3.1's are nearly 2x faster. All in all, this is a great phone and I'm happy to wait for Google to make at least one more version before moving on.",

When the Pixel 2 was launched I decided to purchase it. Things started great! The honeymoon was fantastic! But after a few months and a few OS updates, I started to experience several issues with it. I gone through months of troubleshooting and am now on my 3rd phone. Most of the issues have been worked out except for one HUGE issue. I am unable to maintain a smooth connection on my home WiFi network. I've tried everything and worked with Google support. I get sporadic WiFi connected but has no internet issues constantly. As a result, I am forced to shut down apps or videos several times before things finally reconnect and work again. This also happens on my parent's WiFi. No issues at work or other places. I've also been experiencing text issues the last few weeks, as well. I receive an Error 97: SMS origination denied message when sending texts out. I've spoke to Verizon 4 times and have gone through troubleshooting and they insist there is something wrong with the phone. It has, quite honestly, been maddening. All Google support is willing to do is replace my phone with another refurb. I am beyond frustrated and am extremely disappointed with Google. They've lost a life long fan, and that has been hard for me to admit. Save your money and look elsewhere. Do not invest in this phone!",

This phone isn't small by any means, it's just not approaching a tablet. The snappiness to absolutely every action including camera load speed, smoothness of transitions, instant fingerprint sensor, and seamless browsing. Wait time is virtually zero in every regard. I recommend this as a solid upgrade from a 6p if you're looking for the newest hardware/software combo.",

No applications, not even third party, can access and use the camera (rear or front). Even a factory reset doesn't bring it back to life. Besides that, bluetooth audio streams randomly go silent for 1 to 2 secs, cannot figure out why this happens. It isn't a distance issue as I'm not moving the devices apart from each other and didn't have any issues with my iPhone 6 streaming to the same speaker device. Hoping my carrier will let me leave Google and get a Samsung or LG.",

I haven't realized how bad experience we have on Samsung Android version because the way they kill apps while in background. THey have been doing this since Android 6 and most of the apps doesn't work as they should be. Also, I am pretty sure after a year of owning your phone or Samsung or T-mobile send an update to make it unusable. I only complain with this Phone about the Bluetooth because is crazy and doesn't work correctly with most of the devices. For example in my car, it use to play the last song as soon as it got connected. Now I have to launch the app and hit play and it is so annoying that I don't use my phone any more to listen music. Second, Title, Author doesn't show any more most of the time. This phone cannot handle several devices connected to the Bluetooth. It handle a Smartwatch like a headset, when I try to call, even if I trigger that from the phone send the call to watch. Notifications over the watch have become totally unreliable. If i have a Bluetooth headset and the smartwatch, it's a disaster. And finally, the compass is inverted and not accurate. But, but, but, this phone is still amazing compared with a Samsung.

            "body": "When friends ask me about my Pixel 2, I tell them \"it's all right\". I've been using an iPhone 4 for the past 5 years, so I was looking forward to this phone feeling like a significant upgrade. However, after 2 weeks of using the Pixel 2, it seems my expectations were too high. Compared to iOS, most things on Pixel 2 feel different but rarely better (or worse, to be fair). For example, Google Assistant feels just as limited as Siri - it's only helpful about 20% of the time I use it. Having everything on my phone synced with my web browser (Chrome) is nice, albeit a bit unnerving - I'm constantly reminded about just how much personal information Google has stored. It's cool being able to sign into a site on my phone for the first time using saved login information from my computer, but this feature is a bit inconsistent and does not always work when I expect it to. I like being able to edit notification settings directly from the app icons on my desktop, but overall I feel like I receive far more notifications than I used to on my iPhone (I think because apps on iOS ask upfront if you want notifications whereas on the Pixel 2 you have to seek out these settings). Speaking of notifications, my phone alerted me my cable bill was do in 24 hours - a bill I had already paid a week prior. I think the phone scanned my emails for bill notifications, yet missed the email confirming I paid. Again, I was a bit unnerved that the phone (or Google, or whatever) is scanning my emails. Naive, I know. The camera's nice, though I still get grainy shots when the lighting isn't great (which may be expected?). Camera quality is neither my priority nor something I know much about so I'm unable to say more than pictures look much better than what I used to get on my dated iPhone. I've really only had 1 bad experience so far: I had to download 5-6 different podcast apps to find one that had all of the functionality I was seeking. For whatever reason, Google's default player, Play Music (not to be confused with Play Store, which is a different default app with a similar triangle logo) is missing one of the podcasts I regularly listen to, and a few of the apps I tried that do have this show were missing functionality I wanted. I eventually found an app called Podcast Republic which seems to suit my needs. All in all, it was a hassle to find what I liked, especially compared to iOS where the default podcast player served me so well. One last note: an app (Animal Crossing) stopped working after an update but restarting my phone resolved the issue. Just like a computer, it seems restarting is now the go-to first step in resolving issues, which is certainly manageable but not ideal. Pixel 2 is fine, I slightly regret the purchase mainly because I had such high hopes. I think I would have preferred an iPhone simply for the familiarity (again, I don't feel Android is worse than iOS, I just don't believe the differences are actual improvements).",

            "body": "I love this phone. At first I did not think I would be able to get used to a new phone. I had been using my Galaxy 5 forever and it was in pretty rough shape. Still I really liked it. I decided it was time to up grade. I read the reviews of the seller. Good reviews. The phone is sleek and smooth. The 8 plus is a bit larger than what I am used to. However I like the extra length. The camera is amazing and has some pretty cool features. Slow motion is awesome for video. There are some features, like Bixby that are pre installed on the phone and also Samsung web. When opening gmail there is only the option to open the links up on Samsung web. I am sure this can be changed, but tricky. I do not care for either feature and would rather choose my settings. When you swipe all the way to the left, this Bixby is on your phone. Apparently it is a point system by Samsung. It seems to be ending though, so possibly it will be uninstalled. Over all great phone especially refurbished. Will note that mine did not come with the original charger. This seems to be an isolated case, as most people said theirs did. I have a Samsung dock, and the type c charger will still fit. Good phone very happy. Arrived quickly too!",

            "body": "11/27/18 In the frenzy of Black Friday I bought my S8+ for $340.00 from buySPRY thinking it was a steal. Sadly, when it arrived I immediately noticed it was a refurbished phone, so make sure you check the description of the items you are purchasing, LOL. The phone did not come with any of its original accessories, instead it came with a \"Hand Candy\" cord and wall charger. So far, the phone is in good condition. The only noticeable outside damage is the scratched bottom portion of the phone, but when you turn on the phone it displays weird lines and background apps which is noticeable when the screen is white. Upon further research these weird lines and ghost apps is from \"screen burn-in\", go figure. Anyways, still contemplating on keeping the phone. It did come with a 60 day warranty from the company that refurbished it. 11/28/18 Update: I am not impressed with how fast the battery life drains, nor that the phone will not charge. I am definitely sending it back now.",

            "body": "I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised). I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8 in 5 minutes tops. I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7. It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge. I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8 Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!",

Earphones 2. SIM Card Removal Tool 3. User Manual The cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals. Earphones Have always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker. Phone Condition Body is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket. Screen Condition It came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine. A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside. It\u2019s an expensive device so why people don\u2019t protect it from day one I\u2019ll never know, I guess some don\u2019t care. I have a spare screen protector now. Battery Condition \u2028Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup. Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV. Setting it up Phone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory. Camera No scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp. Speakers No issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops. Microphone, Lighting Port No issues. Works. Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree. \u2028Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can\u2019t tell which negative review belongs to who. It\u2019s as if it was all sold by one seller. Reviewers need to say who their seller was. My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most. \u2028 This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop. I don\u2019t need the latest and greatest, a gently used phone is just as good.",

            "body": "11/21/2019 I bought this phone in August, arrived in original packaging with an Apple charger- worked great with no problems! Like new, camera worked great, absolutely no issues. However, my phone got stolen from me at the end of October. So I ordered a second one- complete opposite experience. Came in a small, dirty box with some weird charger. Had obvious scratches on the screen, and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality. I had been waiting for 3 weeks to replace my phone so I gave it a shot anyway... the microphone did not work at all. When people called, I could hear them and they couldn't hear me- which I had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from AAA, who hung up on me upon my \"lack\" of response when I answered the phone. Took it to T Mobile and chatted online with Apple to do some troubleshooting- turns out it's just a bad refurbished phone, so the only answer was to return it. Disappointed overall- good luck with your order... 12/2/2019 Increasing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Still leaving off one star for the 1 busted up phone, and 1 star for the inconvenience and 3 weeks of waiting to replace my phone- as well as both times the shipping delayed, (however only by 1 day each time, but I think I should mention it since it is listed \"Prime FREE Delivery\"). I ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone. THANK GOODNESS IT PAID OFF. I got another phone, quality as good as the first one. I leave this review after 1.5 weeks of phone 3 with no issues. I will update my review if anything changes but currently I am relieved it worked out.",

Idid not realize that this was the fault of the screen protector until I had received authorization for a return. Just prior to boxing it up, I removed the protector and found out it now worked perfectly. Oh well live and learn.

            "body": "Because of the country I live in it is even too hassling to return it so I have to just sit and fester with the wrong item! Luckily the person I am buying it for isn't fussy but if you are BUYER BEWARE!!! The phone quality was very good otherwise and the storage capacity was as stated. Came with a charger, a plastic screen protector which is best replaced with a useful one and simple black snap case which does nothing to protect the phone. Instead of those things I would have preferred it at least come with the lighting/3.5mm jack converter or the earpods but nah. If you're going to order this, I hope you're not too fussy about which model iPhone or colour you're getting cause it's clearly up in the air. Edit: 2 months later after the person whom I gifted this to started to use the phone, it couldn't hold any charge. Turns out the battery was defective. It was constantly swelling to the point the phone split in two. Brought it in to a technician in the nick of time and even caused a small spark while being fixed in the store. Absolutely DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. THEY CLEARLY CANNOT OR DO NOT REFURBISH PHONES.",

            "body": "i received the phone today, well packaged (NOT in it's original box, but the packaging was appropriate). Upon opening the package and inspection, I was pleasantly surprised to see the original charger and earbuds included... However, i was disappointed to find that the fingerprint scanner was seriously chipped in 2 places by something sharp (see pictures), which made it unusable. I don't think it was worth the price paid, given the fingerprint sensor is broken... but I chose to keep it, i will be using a complex unlock password. And, for \"the good news\", this phone was actually unlocked and i was able to register it on the T-Mo network with zero issues . I seriously question how this phone was \"certified\", though. Again, i don't think it was worth the price paid... but i needed a decent phone, and this one does the job. Buyers out there... BEWARE, and use Amazon's free return shipping if needed - they're awesome.",

            "body": "Phone works great! Got mine from ElectronicDeals. No cracks, scratches, software issues whatsoever. I was honestly really hesitant to buy a refurbished phone but I ended up taking the risk and was not mostly not disappointed. I only had one problem with the phone as a whole: The \"unlocked\" part: When I got the phone I was using MetroPCS but the phone was only half unlocked by Sprint. I was still able to get it activated under Metro and use their service, but signal felt iffy and there was a constant, annoying Sprint OMADM notification in my notification bar. It was out of Metro's hands so I took it to a local Sprint store. They said the only thing they could do was put in a request to get it fully unlocked. They got my number and phone information and I left. Unsatisfied, I decided to try another local Sprint store in the city. The guy at this store said the same thing but he helped me out a bit more. He explained that switching to Sprint would more than likely get rid of notification and improve the service connection. Naturally I was a bit weary about the offer due to being with MetroPCS for long without any problems and he may just be telling me this to make a sale. My worry quickly faded when he told me I would only be paying $25 a month with unlimited everything and I can leave anytime with no strings attached. Like buying the phone in the first place I was hesitant, but ultimately decided to give it a shot. He was right in telling me it would take away the annoying notification and my service is better than ever. Overall, while it all worked out me me in the end, you may want to try to contact the seller before buying just to make sure the phone is 100% unlocked. And if it's not, try to get as much information as possible about so you can unlocked it yourself or at the very least match it up with your current service provider.",

First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it\u2019s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll\ud83d\ude0d. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there\u2019s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn\u2019t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its \ud83d\udcaf percent honest. Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you\u2019ll have to jailbreak your phone.",

It has a long-lasting, removable battery and the camera app launches with a double-click of the home button. The Bad Its underpowered processor makes the photo-capture slow enough to miss action shots. The Bottom Line Light users will do fine with Samsung's entry-level Galaxy J3, but you'll want a higher-powered phone if you plan to keep it around for two years or more.",

Coming from the Galaxy S5, love the Pen, though I have not used it much, besides to write notes, which is nice because of the way its set up you can write notes straight to your home screen. I have set up my side bar with all the app I need quick access to, so that gives me a full screen to write notes on the fly. I doubt I will have any issues with this phone. I don't use the face recognition software, or fingerprint scanner/security so I have nothing to say about that.",

            "body": "I've been a Samsung Galaxy owner for quite a few years now. I even owned a Note 4 which I liked very much. I just upgraded from the Galaxy S8+ and have had this phone for about a week. I love it. The phone feels good in my hand; obviously I like large screen phones. It's powerful, the screen is crystal clear and the camera is excellent to say the least. Since I've only had the phone for a short time I have been playing with it quite a bit, setting it up and adding and using old and new apps. So the battery life I have found to be, still, pretty damn good. I expect that when I start to use it more normally as I have in the past that the battery life on this will exceed pretty much any phone that I've ever had before. One other point. In the past I never really used the Note stylus very much. However, one of the selling points on this model is how functional the stylus has become. I've used it for to take selfies and I love that I can copy text and photos from websites that don't allow you normally (I'm looking at you Instagram!) to copy and paste. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, I believe, for how you can use the stylus. I'm looking forward to finding more shortcuts and other features that I can use it for. I'm a pretty long-term Galaxy owner so I do have a little bias, but I believe I can still honestly say that this is one of the best phones available out there even for the price. And I can highly recommend it to anyone who likes a large phone with a long battery life and a beautiful screen and excellent camera! I hope this review has been helpful to some of you",

The phone itself is great. It's the SM-N960F which allows for dual sim cards. A few unfortunate things I've learned along the way are that, Verizon does not work on dual-sim phones, and Samsung Pay doesn't work in the U.S. with non-US phones. I ended up having to use Google Pay on my phone instead. The phone has great battery life. Great for multi-tasking and a fantastic display. It's not the cheapest phone but compared to competing flagships its ahead of everyone else in terms of hardware and software features.",

The only way that I could tell that it was used it that it complained about a Sim card change once I powered it up. Totally great experience and battery life is still more than a day with moderate use (but then again I was using Android Auto, so it was actually charging in the car). I'm totally happy with it and glad that I didn't let my hesitations get the better of me,and went ahead and picked it up! My poor tablets are now being regularly ignored, too!

Not happy I have had problems with this phone from day one and none has been resolved up til now Call quality very poor: Call drop, no transmission, fading out, etc all happening with each call. Literally. Phone app stopped working multiple times per day, retarding the dialing process. There is a metro pcs pop-up that keeps showing up that i just can't get rid of. I am not a metro pcs subscriber. I have to restart the phone multiple times per day to refresh the phone so i can get the basic functions and internet working The phone app hangs up multiple times per day rendering all calls blocked Widgets (irrelevant to me) are preloaded and i could not add my own Personalizing the homescreen and the settings was blocked Touch-screen shaky Pros: Dual SIM Unlocked It's a smaller size large phone Picture quality is good Battery life excellent (only 2 months use) Lovely colour I tried contacting the seller then Amazon multiple times regarding these issues but no response. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude15\u2639\ufe0f",

            "body": "EDITED on Oct. 3, 2019: I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy J2 Core 2018 Factory Unlocked 4G LTE (USA Latin Caribbean) Android Oreo SM-J260M phones. - I bought the phones as low cost option for voice/text/internet access within US and for international travel. I'd give the phones 4 stars. -Came in original Samsung packaging -Unlocked - I used sim cards I purchased -I bought the phones to use in USA and trips outside the USA. EDITED: Used these two phones on 2 week trip outside the US. I purchased sim cards from a world phone service. They worked fine at multiple states in USA, and in UK (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland), Republic of Ireland, Guernsey channel Island (UK), and in Normandy, France. So, frequency bands available on the phone are sufficient for those countries. I'm very satisfied. -My main uses are voice, text messaging, and internet access. Those phone features work fine. -The phones are marketed for Latin America. To find an English-language user manual for this model I could print, I went to Samsung site for Bermuda. The full length manual was helpful to me as a new Android phone user. Helpful, but it left a lot of information out. (The manual can be accessed via the phone.) -Main limitation: EDITED: None. The system software updated problem I saw when I first bought the phones (see below) has been resolved. One phone informed me that a system software update (Android) was ready to download and install. It worked properly and updated to the August 2019 software. On the other phone I used the update system software option in settings and that resulted in a successful system software update. The problem I mentioned in the original review has been resolved. FIXED: \"Updating the system software \"over the air\" (Settings...System...Software Update) does not work for both phones. It results in \"Registration Failed\" message. I believe this occurs because it is an International (Latin America) phone and Samsung's US support does not \"register\" non-US phones. (The phones cannot be registered on Samsung's US web site, either.) I successfully updated the system software from my Windows PC by using Samsung Smart Switch software. This updated the system software from March 2019 - which was on the boxed phones - to June 2019. Contact with Samsung chat and phone support did not resolve this problem. Support recommended I take the phones to local service. I'm going to do the system updates manually with my computer. - App installation and updates work fine. It is the Android system updates that must be done manually.\"--FIXED",

Can hardly open any app without it taking a few minutes or longer if you can get them to open. Never received notice of voicemails, ringer volume never stays on. And can list way more. Not worth a $1. Don't buy it!!!! Horrible!",

            "body": "I upgraded from a Moto G3 to this Moto G5s plus. On the G3, the back camera is recessed to avoid scratches and such. On the G5splus the camera is raised, don\u2019t know what the designers were thinking. I call that a design flaw. Another problem is the shutter speed when taking pictures of moving objects. I have tried about 30 times and have been unable to take a non-blurry picture of a slowly moving object. I turned off the HDR and Google Lens but it made no difference. I never had this problem with the G3. As others have noted there is some problem with the cell network with this phone and being in the USA; and in my case, Cricket. I've read lots of forums and posts and tried lots of different settings etc. etc. but 95% of the time my phone uses cell network H rather than LTE. I went to one site that suggested that this international model will never do LTE inside US and using Cricket. Would love Motorola to put out a patch to overcome this problem. (in addition to a patch to fix the camera) Anyway, it\u2019s a nice phone, bigger than I wanted. If anyone at Lenovo is reading this, here is your next phone to release and it will sell like hot cakes: Take this phone, replace the \"dual\" cameras on the back with a single camera with a faster shutter speed, recess the camera as in past models, and make the whole phone 20% smaller. Name it the Moto G5s Compact. Update 3/19/2019 - I am now actively looking for a new phone. I was ok with this phone not being LTE but daily it will lose all Internet access whether on wifi or not. During that time it looses all cell usage as well. If I reboot the phone, things start working again. I reboot this phone at least once a day. My Moto G3 was made before Lenovo and was a really good phone. I will never buy another Moto phone.",

            "body": "Pros: Phone is cheaper than the G5 Plus and has better specs. Cons: 1) The charger has an international plug, which plugs into a US adapter. The attachment is so loose and the construct so top heavy that almost any movement will unplug the international plug from the adapter and fall to the floor, hopefully not taking your phone with it. 2) Far fewer choices when it comes to protective cases for this model when compared to the G5 Plus. The Problem: After the phone booted up for the first time it instructed me to download updates to the OS, which I did. After all the updates and syncing my accounts the phone worked fine for maybe 30 minutes before starting to repeatedly reboot, over and over again for no reason, before turning off. Eventually some red text appeared saying that the phone failed to boot and that I needed to connect it to my computer and use the \"Software Repair Assistant\". Went looking for the program on the company website only to find out that nothing by that name exists. Turns out that what Lenovo/Motorola actually has is a program called the \"Lenovo Smart Assistant\". Figuring out that the two were the same took far too much digging. I downloaded and installed the program and got to work using the rescue feature. Turns out that the Motorola G5S Plus isn't called that in the software, it's called the \"MOTO G Plus 5th Gen. S\" which is just the extra added tiny nuisance that a frustrated customer needs when they are desperately trying to get their new phone to work. Followed the instructions, a bunch of yellow text scrolled through my phone then a red line of text saying that boot failed, and the \"Smart Assistant\" would tell me that the software couldn't connect to my phone. Tried that over and over again until somehow my phone miraculously started working again. And for a brief 30 minutes or so I was happy, getting my settings configured and my apps organized. Until it randomly rebooted three more times in a row and then went dark. The next day I tried repeatedly to get the phone to work, or even respond to any inputs at all, nothing. It would not turn on, soft reboot, or hard reboot. The only sign of life was a little blinking light that appeared when I plugged it in to charge, and that too eventually stopped. I will be returning this brick back to Motorola and will update the review based on what happens next. Regardless, I will be losing the screen protector that I put on before I started the phone up, which is just and extra bit of annoyance to top it all off.",

            "body": "First, to start this off, this phone is NOT CDMA compatible. That means it will not work with Verizon or US Cellular. It will only work with TMobile or AT&T, or a carrier that goes through one of them, such as Cricket. The phone itself might be metal, and while the back of it looks really nice and solid, the phone is actually extremely light. The front looks cheap, and the fingerprint sensor sticks up enough above the glass that if you run your fingernail across the screen it will catch on the sensor. As far as performance, I have no complaints. The phone is extremely fast. When it comes out of the box, it will be installed with Android version 7.1.0. There is about 4 hours worth of updates to install, but the phone does eventually install Android version 8.1.0. The phone seems to handle games just fine, and there is no lag when loading apps like some cheaper phones. The phone performs better than my previous phone which was a Motorola E4 Plus. The E4 wins in every single category except performance. It looked better and felt better to hold. If you don't use your phone too much, and just need something for checking Instagram and Snapchat occasionally etc, I would recommend getting the E4 plus. It's battery life is almost double that of the G5s. If you want a phone more for gaming, but don't really have the money for something expensive, then get the G5s plus. Just keep in mind that the G5S is only unlocked on GSM carriers.",

The phone constantly drops down to 3G and stays there, if I get it back to LTE and make a phone call, it's back to 3G and stays there. The data connection even in LTE is abysmal. Also, the sensor malfunctions when you talk, I put calls into mute countless times while holding it to my head. The screen brightness is a bit dim even turned all the way up, I compared it to two other phones and it's very noticeable. The flashlight is quite dim too.

So far, using this phone has been very responsive and great. I love the fact that it supports an SD card and works on the Verizon network. I have not experienced any slowdowns or lagging. Tested a few games without issues. The camera quality is quite good. I'd say at this price point, you can't beat the quality. It truly does feel like a flagship phone due to the optimizations that have been done to the Android OS. The pop out menu for one handed mode is a nice feature as well. Also, the battery life has held up really nicely. I get a full day's usage out of mine. The form factor is the only thing that takes some getting used to, but it makes using the phone much nicer for reading or watching videos. On standard 16:9 videos you can pinch to zoom if you would like it without black bars. This is done pretty seamlessly. Overall 10/10 for this price. I love the stylish look and design of the device. I do highly recommend this phone. I've upgraded from an LG V20 and I'm not looking back any time soon.",

Honestly, it's not a bad phone but it's not a great one either.. and for the price I expected it to be a little better considering the competition in the same price range. Using it after having a s8 for 2 years felt like a downgrade especially the screen resolution and color saturation (LCD vs AMOLED). Also One UI just feels more intuitive and advanced, but that's my preference. Watching a video on this thing was really nice tho, the screen aspect ratio did make for a great viewing experience. Camera is not good. Telefoto 2x zoom was cool, but overall I expected alot more from a Sony camera considering they make great cameras. I know it's a mid-range phone but 4k video is one of the selling points of this phone. My biggest disappointment was finding out that Sony does not even enable PS4 remote play on this phone. The only reason I even considered a Sony phone was to use it for remote play with my PS4 .. but I guess Sony only enables remote play for their \"flagship\" phones (i.e fork over $1,000 or you're S.O.L). That to me is just greed, as I see no reason they can't enable this feature for their mid-range phones. I get why they wouldn't allow other Android phones to do so (even though they allow iOS users to) but come on... Anyway will be returning this phone.",

So I don't know what to tell you the value isn't worth it you be better off getting a phone with higher megapixels if you are a photographer otherwise if you are not this might be a good phone for you. But it's not for me. I like how it fits in my hand better and my hand doesn't have to adjust to how large the other phone was but I finally got over the cramps LOL. And I love most of my Xperia.

            "body": "Hello. I purchased this phone for my wife's birthday party. A note about shipping is after my review. I purchased this phone for my wife. Her previous phone was a Microsoft Lumia 950, pushing 3 years of usage. This was a very good upgrade from that phone. The size difference was easily distinguishable and the first thing she noticed. The width is skinnier than the Lumia 950. The screen is also bigger, about an inch longer diagonally. She has small hands and it's perfect for her to grip with one hand and use. She's always used 2 hands for her smart phones so it's still a habit for her to use two hands with this, but I see her using one hand more often than before. Next, after turning on and setting up the phone, the next noticeable thing was the amount of apps available. On the Lumia 950 she had to go through a website or just not participate due to lack of apps in the Windows store, but now that hasn't been an issue. She's been able to download a bunch of apps that have been very useful (for example, the Walmart app allows for Walmart Pay and she used the app to pay for a transaction in-store when she forgot her credit card at home). Last, she loves the camera and massive screen. She casually takes photographs but really enjoys the 21:9 aspect ratio for taking wide photos. She uploads to Instagram to show her family and friends back at her hometown and the quality of the photos that came from the Xperia 10 have been great. For me, I prefer something more mid-range (I have the Honor View 10 which IMO takes better quality photos and runs smoother) so I personally would rate this as \"good enough\" but for her, it greatly surpasses her basic needs and she loves the phone. Quick tip: she set up fingerprint unlock once for her thumb and it would misread her print a great deal, so I had her \"register\" another fingerprint when in actuality she just registered her thumb a second time and now it rarely misreads her fingerprint. Finally, a note about shipping: I preordered the phone on March 13 for my wife's birthday present, it released on March 18, and was marked as shipped on March 20. A week went by with no shipping updates so I called Amazon support and the representative said that it was stuck at the warehouse, so she would send another phone rush delivery and when the original phone arrives to send it back. The second phone arrived on March 28, a few days after my wife's birthday. I received the original phone in mid-April and sent it back. [EDIT] This phone gets one less star due to some apps just not working properly. I installed the McDonald's app and Nike SNKRS app and both won't properly connect, even though mine doesn't have any problems. It could be because her Google account is originally from another country that is now being used in the United States but I don't know. On her phone, the McDonald's app won't show daily deals and she cannot do mobile order, and the SNKRS app just keep saying there's an error when trying to log in.",

            "body": "I'm very disappointed because I love this phone! But I got it in like the first week of May and It started giving me issues now. The touch sensation on screen stops working out of nowhere. I can be texting then the touch stops working I have to press the side button to go back then it will work but even that sometimes takes several attempts then it works. Kinda frustrating because I feel like any day now i won't be able to do anything no texting or answering calls. Since I got it when I put someone on speaker the other person can't hear me but if I leave it on normal speaker they can but I don't use speaker much so didn't really care so much but now all together it's alot of things. Also the GPS sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't. Life on battery now compared to when I just got it sucks. I am now looking to buy a new phone because don't know how long this one will last me and I'm considering not getting Sony.",

            "body": "I like the form factor, a long phone, which is ergonomic. Sony's version of Android is extremely cut down and simple. The Xperia 10's speakers are amazing. The speakers are the best that I have ever heard. The sound seems extremely natural and comparable to stand alone speakers. The camera is solid, but it's auto focus on macro shots are questionable at times. The battery life is decent for a puny 2870 mAh battery. I only use the phone for reading, web surfing, and non-intense tasks. I can get by charging it once every two days. After significant battery degradation and wear and tear in the future, I worry that the battery life will be poor. Also, I suspect that I bought an open-box phone because the box appeared to be re-taped. The smartphone's plastic packaging appeared to be opened because a significant amount of dust was inside the plastic packaging. The cables and charging adapter looked brand new. Then again, I paid $295, which was discounted $54 from MSRP, so I understand that Amazon.com had to off-load their other inventory at a discounted rate. I hope Sony's smartphone division can break even or be profitable again because they make solid phones at the mid-range price point. The Xperia 10's bizarre long 21:9 body design is a strong step forward to try new designs to differentiate themselves from the competition. If Sony shuts down its smartphone business, it's going to be a dull world with only Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi dominating with their boring designs.",

If it does not work for you return it in time to get a refund. I went back to my Note 4 and I'm going to wait for the Note 10 to see if it is worth it.

            "body": "Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program. I actually use an iPhone, so it was pleasant to come back to Android to see some of the things I miss. This phone is unlocked with dual Sim availability, apparently works with most major carriers, I had no problem with a prepaid SIM from AT&T for $35 (cancel anytime) with 1GB of data which I used to test it out. At just over $400, that\u2019s less than half the price of an iPhone XS The Xperia 10 Plus has a super long screen, or CinemaWide as Sony refers to the 21:9 panel. Although it looks fairly incongruous, it\u2019s fairly easy to handle as it is quite thin and relatively narrow. However you do require a lot of thumb stretching on this Plus model. The screen is oddly not beveled, maybe Sony are trying to buck a trend or be \u201cnew\u201d but it feels a little square and awkward in the hand. The screen itself is fabulous as like the flagship Xperia 1 it boasts IPS LCD with 1080p+ resolution (1,080 x 2,520px). There are dual cameras on the back with a 12MP main module (1/2.8\u201d sensor) and an 8MP telephoto camera (2x zoom, only does photos). The phone can record 4K videos (in 16:9 and 21:9 formats) and features SteadyShot (electronic stabilization). The 8MP selfie camera is identical to the one on the Xperia 1. The Snapdragon 636 chipset offers a performance upgrade over the old XA2 phones as it features four Cortex-A73 based cores in addition to the A53 cores. The phone has 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, plus a microSD slot for up to 512GB more (are you listening Apple!) The OS is stock, with some features from Sony including Side sense with the App Pair that automatically launches two apps in a pre-defined top-bottom split-screen view. Early impression is that this is a cool phone, but I will have to play with it some more. 4 stars.",

            "body": "As someone who had been a loyal Sony customer, it's hard for me when the first word that came to my mind, as I write this review, is 'disappointed'. And that word summarizes how I feel about the Sony Xpedia 10 Plus. And the feature that I dislike the most about this phone, is that it has an embedded, rechargeable battery that can only be replaced by an authorized Sony repair center. So, I won't going to give away my current phone, because the day this one needs a new battery, and gets shipped to a 'Sony repair center', I would need a backup phone, or will be left without a phone. As simple as that. I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant, but just think about it. Sending my phone to a 'Sony repair center', means sending a device which contains my most private and sensitive information to unknown people. And the only way to prevent the data from exposure, it's to wipe it clean before shipping the device. Well, I still would need another phone until this one gets returned. And there is the waste of time setting up this phone again. Not to mention the fee paid to the 'Sony repair center'. My frustration with this issue comes from the fact that in the last ten years, every phone I've ever owned allows me to order a second battery, which I could replace myself, and even carry as a possible backup. Please don't get me wrong, I like some features in this phone, but I'm disappointed at its obvious flaws. What were the people who designed it, thinking? Or rather, not thinking. Seriously, the so called 'SIM card tray' is the flimsy thing ever related to any phone. It's so fragile that they shouldn't had bothered including it. Well, the SIM card tray holds the nano SIM card, and works as a cover for the micro memory card slot too. I suggest placing the phone down, with the rear camera facing you, before carefully removing the SIM card tray. Because the nano SIM card goes on that side of the tray. Also, related to this SIM card tray, you should know that there is essential information under it. Usually, the IMEI number information for a phone is under its battery, but since in this case, the Xperia comes completely sealed, they had to find another place to store the IMEI number information. Well, it's under the SIM card tray, one must use a fingernail to pull out two tiny thin pieces of plastic with said information. Or dial *#06# into the phone to get the IMEI number. Using either method, just make sure to save such information in another location, in case the phone get lost, or stolen. It's necessary to report it as such. So, is there anything I like about the Xperia 10 Plus? Sure, there are plenty of things, like the fact that is 5Ghz Wi-Fi capable, so the streaming of videos and gaming are better. And of course, the 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi is also supported. And the Sony Xpedia 10 Plus, can be used with only Wi-Fi, no nano SIM card needed for using this phone if one doesn't want to. I tried my AT&T SIM with it, and it was a plug and play, I didn't even have to register with AT&T. Besides that, I like that it comes with Android 9 Pie running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which makes it a very fast Smartphone. And it has a wide high quality and clear display. It also uses mostly Android apps, and the Sony apps included are not bothersome. One can use them, or disable them without problems. Both cameras are good, and the USB-C type connector for charging and data transfer, is a great feature. A charging cable with a USB-C type connector on one end, and a USB A connector on the other end, it's supplied, together with a wall-charger to use with it. And this phone is heavier than any other I've ever had, it's more like a Tablet than a Smartphone, so I'm probably be using it as such. Yes, most Tablets are really twice as large as the Sony Xpedia 10 Plus, but in the practice, I just realized that this phone is better for watching videos, reading and gaming, than my current Android phone.",

            "body": "Update 2019-08-13: Touch screen unresponsiveness became so frustrating that I sat down to reset the phone by erasing everything from the phone. I first removed the SD card which is next to SIM card and I had to remove SIM card first. When I reinserted SIM, phone rebooted and I noticed that the touch screen was functioning normally. I was very happy that removal of SD card solved the problem, but that happiness lasted less than one day. Even though the problem now comes less often, it is very annoying nonetheless. It happens when Amber Alert is blaring or when a reminder goes off or when the phone is ringing. Embarrassing when I am at work, meeting, or a public place. I will keep this phone for now and look for black Friday deals to replace this phone. Definitely not worth the hassle. Update 2019-07-19: After having used this device for several months, I am so annoyed that I really dislike this phone. 1) Main problem now is that the touch screen suddenly decides to not react to touch commands. It could happen any time. But, I hate it when it happens when an alarm or reminder comes up or when I am getting a call. Only way to overcome the problem then is to turn off the screen and turn it back again. 2) Finger print sensor doesn't always work reliably. Even when I have clean and dry finger. This problem is not as annoying and I can tolerate this. 3) Keyboard typing is not accurate. I think the problem is due to the phone size. I have reduced star rating. I would not recommend this device to anybody. Original Review: We got the phone in 10 Plus style (6.5\" screen) in black color. Specifications on this phone are very good, but 21:9 size is inconvenient for use. I don't think it is easy to get used to - my wife is still annoyed with the form factor after a couple of weeks of usage. We are using the phone with T-Mobile service and it works well. I removed the SIM card from the current phone to this phone and it worked quite well. Google facilitates data transfer from old phone to the new phone with minimal effort. I have not used a microSD card because 64GB space is more than sufficient for now. Phone comes with Android Version 9 (Pie). Every time there's a major version upgrade, user interface is changed in many areas. That brings new annoyances due to unfamiliar interface and learning curve. Phone function: Connection, sound, and microphone work as expected and no problems observed. Screen: Picture quality, resolution, clarity, colors, etc. are excellent. 21:9 aspect ratio allows for less scrolling, but not worth due to the size inconvenience attached to it. If you are into watching extra wide screen movies on your phone, then you will really enjoy this aspect ratio. Finger print sensor: Unlike most phones, the sensor is on the side. This phone is quite thin, so you can imaging how narrow this sensor could be. It works very well, but not always. When it doesn't work, it complains again and again, and then quits saying \"too many failed attempts.\" You have to unlock using the PIN at this point. Camera: 2X optical zoom is a great functionality. You can use volume controls to zoom in and out at incremental values without having to pinch on the screen. Photos come out quite good, but other phones can take equal or better photos. Built-in bokeh effect works very well and the background is blurred to make the subject look better. Battery is not replaceable by customer. USB-C is used for charging. Overall I think it is a good device, with the exception of handling inconvenience due to the form factor. I have loaded some photos so you can compare the phone size relative to $20 bill and Motorola Moto G Plus.",

            "title_review": "Curious hybrid of media player and phone",
            "body": "Although I'm quite pleased with my LG K8, a humble device that costs 1/4 as much as this Sony, I was curious to try out the latest version of Android (9 Pie) on a true high-definition screen with three times as many pixels. Held vertically, both phones are about 2 3/4\" across, a comfortable width for any pocket. But at 6 1/2\", the Sony is a full inch taller, enough to overfill most of the pockets in the pants I wear, and too big to cram into the pockets of my favorite jackets. If you normally carry your phone in a purse or briefcase, the extra length probably won't matter. Sony's marketing touts the 21:9 display of the Xperia 10 Plus as ideal for viewing video \"in the same aspect ratio your favorite movies are recorded in\" (quoting their Web site). This may be true if your favorite movies were recorded (or photographed) in the ultrawide format popularized by CinemaScope in the 1950s, and still employed by many theatrical features released annually. But a substantial number of theatrical movies, and nearly all programs produced for home broadcast or Web streaming, are intended for display on a standard HD TV/monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Viewed on this device, these videos are \"pillarboxed,\" centered on the screen with substantial black margins on either side of the image. 33% of the available pixels go unused. The dual-lens rear camera lets you shoot movies in 21:9 format, which look very dramatic when played on a screen with a similar aspect ratio. Happily, movies aren't the only use for those extra pixels. Held vertically, the Sony lets you see substantially more of a scrolling Web site or Kindle page than a standard phone. A handy feature lets you split the screen, showing one app on the top half and another below. I'm happy to report that the Xperia sports a standard 1/8\" stereo headphone jack as well as Bluetooth 5 with aptX for wireless audio transmission. Sony claims that the audio chip directly supports HD audio (LPCM, FLAC, ALAC and DSD) with up to 24-bit 192kHz resolution, and can play almost any audio file you can throw at it, including Vorbis, Opus and even MIDI. (Maximum DSD resolution is not specified; probably DSD64). I plugged in my Sennheiser 650s and played a couple of especially fine 24/192 HD tracks (James Taylor's \"Mud Slide Slim,\" the Dunedin Consort's \"Mass in B Minor\" by Bach). They sounded pretty darned good. Audiophiles who want to avoid the bother and expense of an external DAC should take notice. UI responsiveness is very good, thanks to a decent Qualcomm 636 processor and 4 GB of RAM. The 64GB of built-in storage can be augmented by a micro SD card with up to 512 GB capacity, enough to hold a VERY large collection of lossless audio files and HD movies. A pity that the 3000 mA battery is not user-replaceable. There oughta be a law. Ergonomically, the phone is easy to hold, at least vertically. The power button, fingerprint sensor and volume controls are placed for convenient access, if you're right-handed. This phone is a good choice for cinephiles into widescreen epics, music lovers into HD audio, and workaholic multitaskers. But Is the increased width of the Xperia's screen worth the awkwardness of its form factor? Only you can decide.",

No quick start or any paperwork to demonstrate the features of the phone, . It has a nice feel. Good color in the photos. Photos are nice, not the best, but good. Listened to Youtube and the sound was good. I can't test the phone audio. The screen is a nice 6\" size with nice clarity and color. So overall, I pulled stars off this because of the condition of the phone I got (used, and no SIM and no smart guide). But overall this phone is nice for the price.",

            "body": "I've been using the Sony Experia 10 Mobile phone for Android development testing purposes for a couple of weeks. I'm enjoying the non-standard, tall 21:9 display which has very sharp resolution. Although I've not watched much streaming video content, holding the phone in landscape mode provides nice resolution and aspect ratio. The photos I've taken are pleasing and rendered well on the display. I understand from other reviews that the battery life of this phone is substandard but I've been satisfied with the battery life so far compared to other Android phones I've used. I don't play games that might drain the battery quickly so, if you're a gamer, please beware of potentially substandard battery life. The good news is that the phone charged quickly using the included USB cable. I wish the phone supported wireless charging but it does not. The build quality looks good, which is expected of a Sony product. The phone feels comfortable in my hand although it is a little slippery so finding some kind of phone case is probably a good idea. However, due to the non-standard size, you're probably limited to Sony-only cases. I did find training the fingerprint reader to be quite tricky and time consuming. Once trained, however, it's very nice that the display powers up just by using the reader. The audio quality has been satisfactory. While I'm not a power user, this phone has worked well for me and is well-priced for the features and performance it offers.",

Battery has more to be desired from it. Will last through the day but middle of the pack for sure. Camera is great in daylight and good artificial lighting. Low is ok at best. Definitely better than the Essential PH-1 but can be better. The shutter lag is the worse I have ever seen. The OS overall is smooth but there are stutters. Either more RAM or a better SOC would have been a better choice one way or the other compared to what is existing. The 10 Plus is the one to choose in the mid-range between the Sony phones.",

            "title_review": "Coming from the most loyal Sony customer on the planet",
            "body": "It pains me to write this because I consider myself a loyal Sony customer ON THE PLANET (Try me, son!). I have owned the Xperia TL, Z, Z1, Z2, Z5 Premium, XZ Performance and now the Xperia 10 Plus. I only purchased this phone because my XZ Performance broke (fell off my motorcycle and ran over by an SUV). I figured this phone can hold me off until the Xperia 1 comes out which I was so excited about. I have nothing but regret with this phone. I have never regretted buying a Sony product, regardless of the money I have spent (Bravia 65x900F, 65A8f, LSPX-P1 & s1, HT-ST5000, Xperia Z tablets and who knows how many bluetooth speakers, earphones and speakers). If this is not being shafted by Sony I do not know what is. So let's go over the garbage that is the Xperia 10 Plus. First, there is NO camera button. The reason why this is so important is because up to this point the camera button was used to be able to take a picture without having to fully authenticate. Now, you must fully login and find the \"Camera App.\" The brains at Sony thought they could mitigate this by added the \"Camera App\" to all main screens. I can't express how much of a FAIL this is. This is embarrassing. Next on the embarrassment list are the speakers. Sony decided that the new 21:9 scale phone is the new direction and I was all on board. When using the phone you realize that the speakers are on the bottom of the phone. Did anyone at Sony hold this phone let alone use it? You CAN'T use a 21:9 ratio aspect phone WITHOUT covering the bottom of the phone, which muffles/completely silences the sound. My hand is now a claw that needs to clamp down on the phone in a way that I do not cover the bottom, let along lean in on anything that will cover the speakers. Again, I challenge ANYONE at Sony to prove to me that you actually used this phone. If you guys have, then God help us you shouldn't be making Phones. Another slap in the face is the fact that the Power button and the fingerprint reader have been decoupled. Any one who has used the previous phones will know that they used to be the same. International versions have the fingerprint reader/power button enabled while the US versions did not (Thank the loser patent trolls for that one). It was great to have them together because I can do two very important this at once. Turn on the phone and authenticate. These were separated with the XZ2 and XZ3 in favor of the Fingerprint reader being in the back. Now they have been moved again moving the fingerprint read below the power button, which gives birth to many of awkward moments powering on the phone then going to authenticate with fingerprint to just say screw it here is my pattern. This is as FAIL as it gets. What gets me the most is that Sony already is stumbling over themselves on how to solve this problem and are coming off as incompetent. Solve the problem and stick to your solution! Why would I follow your lead if you can't even follow your own. I also probably wouldn't be as upset it ANY one of my Sony bluetooth devices (x2 WI-1000X, x2 WF-1000x, LSPX-P1, LSPX-S1, SRS-S3) actually worked as Trusted devices and let me in pre-authenticated. I can go on and on about how bad this phone is. I have about lost faith in Sony, with regards to phones and will most likely still consider the Xperia 1, probably because it seems I am a glutton for punishment. Sony, you guys should be embarrassed by this phone. If you guys were so keen on staying in the game, why would you drop this on to your customers? Blows my mind that you guys would give the people that have made these decisions ANY power to make make key decisions that go against your core values. Sounds like you need to relocate some of your staff to Sony Alaska. To anyone who works hard for their money, stay away from this phone. You will not be the envy of your friends, but rather the butt of their jokes. Sony, get your stuff together! This is unacceptable. Other issues with the phone: - Headphone jack broke already - Camera has green and red burst; most likely a damaged lens",

That said on to the talk of the xperia10. First off this is not, I repeat NOT a flagship phone. That being said you will have a lower quality screen resolution(hd+), ram size unless you get the Chinese release with 6gb, chipset, and Camera quality. Note also that the last 4 phones I have had were all flagships with 4k screens (lg/Samsung). The screen on xperia 10 is fantastic looking with its ability to showcase 21:9 video and pictures. Even though there is no 4k support, I'm pleased with what the screen shows. The battery is not all that impressive only being 3000mah but it does just fine getting you through a day of even above average use including video. The chipset is the same as last year model xa2, but can still run all current games, but with lowered quality. Most games however do not support 21:9 ratios. The camera can get the job done, but has a challenge in low light with a large presence of noise in the photos. Recording can be done with the 21:9 ratio and looks relatively good. It has a headphone jack which is a cool win in my book. Has one exterior bottom speaker that is a just ok like every other phone including flagships. But as a first Sony phone, I can easily say that I'm in full support and will recommend this phone to anyone wondering about it. Yes the phones can be over priced as Sony typically does that, but it's really not hard to find it at a good price (even the xperia 1) if you just do a little digging and are patient to find the right deal.",

            "body": "Let me preface this review by stating that I currently own an iPhone XR. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Xperia I thought it would be a fun experience, but that I would never consider switching from iOS. I came away so impressed with Android and the Xperia that I seriously considered switching, but I am too entrenched in the Apple ecosystem to make the move at this point. The Xperia is a very nicely made phone and is constructed using high quality materials. The front is all glass, while the back is a warp-around metal shell. The phone has nice weight to it and feels substantial, but not heavy. Size-wise it is the same thickness as the iPhone XR and a bit taller and narrower. The Xperia does not flex when handled. Despite being priced several hundred dollars less than my iPhone XR the Sony feels every bit as well constructed, even if the materials used aren't quite as nice. The Sony has the power/lock switch on the right side about 1/3 down from the top. Below that is the fingerprint scanner, and below that is the volume rocker. On the bottom is the USB-C charging port (no wireless charging is supported) and stereo speakers. On the left hand side of the phone is the port for the SIM and Micro-SD cards. The rear of the phone has the dual cameras and LED flash. The only issues I had are that it's easy to cover the speakers when watching videos and the buttons for power and volume are barely raised and difficult to press. With that said, I love the position of the fingerprint scanner. It's a natural place for it to be as my thumb automatically touches it as I pick up the phone. The scanner was very responsive and I never had to wait on it. Speaking of not waiting on things, I found the Sony to be very responsive in use. It rarely left me hanging whether I was opening apps, playing games, surfing the web, or taking photos. The processor and RAM are more than sufficient for most users, unless you are heavy into processor intensive games. I will note that the iPhone XR felt a bit faster than the Sony, however. Also, OK Google is not as responsive as Siri. The Sony's screen is large, bright, and colorful. The resolution is great and the screen is sharp and clear. I did notice at times that the colors could be unnaturally oversaturated, however, and the auto-brightness adjustment sometimes takes a few seconds to adjust. The screen is very responsive to touch, and typing, scrolling, and zooming operate smoothly. The extra-wide aspect ratio allows some videos to completely fill the screen without letterboxing, but some content will have bars on the left/right sides, so it's a mixed bag. The 13 Megapixel rear camera is an excellent. One thing to know is that the second 5 Megapixel camera isn't used to take photos. It's used for the Bokeh purposes (blurring the background behind subjects) to assist in distance mapping. The main camera offers a lot of control over settings and filters and takes high quality photos. Photos in bright light are detailed and sharp, while low light photos have good color and brightness. The flash is very bright. The camera has a built-in image stabilizer for sharper photos in low light. The Bokeh effect works well when it functions properly4, but sometimes the camera can struggle identifying a subject. Videos are recorded at a maximum resolution of 4K, but the phone pops up a message that states that it can overheat taking 4K video. Videos are sharp and clear with good sound recording. Battery life is more than capable. The phone lasts me about 2 days before I feel the need to charge it again. I use my phone moderately throughout the day to text, check e-mail, surf the web, stream music, watch a couple of short YouTube videos, and play the occasional game for about a half hour. I leave the screen at about half brightness and have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on at all times. All in all... an impressive Android phone that is well designed, nicely made, and performs well.",

            "body": "Sony's Xperia 10 Plus was quite a disappointment specification wise. I will make this pretty simple and self explanatory. 1. 4GB of Ram 2. Battery 3. Camera Quality and Processor. The only thing Sony got right was the size and screen of the phone. Now for everyone else out there dont shit on Sony too much. These recently released phones are still great but the only category I could fit this into would be someone who needs a basic smartphone and have difficulty with small screen sized phones or those who mainly play games and watch movies. However, if the specs on the Xperia 1 are true then I will definitely be purchasing it. All this phone needs to have is at least the specs of the Sony Xperia XZ3 or Galaxy S10. So far this seems like it will happen next December which makes me excited. Otherwise 4/5 stars. Keep going Sony. Update... July 12th release for US.",

            "title_review": "WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE FOR QUALITY AND ALL SONY PHONES FOR POOR SUPPORT",
            "body": "UPDATE 3: Sony returned my \"repaired\" phone after a month. The \"repaired\" phone's screen also stops responding randomly. It is not an isolated issue. See talk(dot)sonymobile(dot)com/t5/Xperia-10-Plus/Touch-screen-problem-10plus/td-p/1372533 UPDATE 2: Sony had my phone for 25 days now. They said the main board had to be replaced to solve the randomly unresponsive touch screen issue. Sony is clearly outside of their promised 14 business days turnaround time with no apologies. The customer service has to be one of the worst in the industry. Even after the case number is assigned to the issue, they still take 2 days to respond. At one point I asked where my phone was and they promised an update within 24 hours, but they didn't respond in over 24 hours so I had to ask again. They said my phone will go out in the next shipment, yet failed to tell me when that is. Two days later still not information on whether it has been shipped back to me. I am very frustrated and angry at Sony. They are clearly loosers and a fringe player in the US smart phones market. Previously, I passed on good deals for One Plus and Razer flagship phones fearing lack of support, and stuck with Sony phones for some fantasy of an efficient warranty coverage should anything go wrong, but, lo and behold, you are in luck, inept support is available Sony too. UPDATE 1: It's been two and a half months using this phone. Screen becomes randomly unresponsive. I have to lock it by pressing the power switch, unlock it with a PIN or fingerprint, and then it works for some time until it becomes unresponsive again. Sometimes I have to lock and unlock it a few times before it starts responding again. It is happening at different times of day, sometimes several times in a row and sometimes it doesn't happen for hours. Sometimes it happens right after I unlock the phone and sometimes in the middle of me using it. I did a data erase complete factory reset of the phone hoping that the problem would go away, but it is still happening. Sony email support takes 1-2 days to respond. 2 days after my initial email they recommended a reset using a PC program called Sony Companion. That, of course, didn't work like the reset from the phone didn't work, which I report to them the same day. Another two days pass by, they ask for IMEI. I provide it to them the same day. Another day passes by, they say the phone is under warranty and they would send a FedEx label but need my address, other info, and IMEI again. I send all this info to them the same day, next day they tell me a lable will be issued. Another day passes, the issue the label. Very inefficient, slow process. Sony told me the repairs will take up to 14 business days from the moment they receive it, no loaner would be provided. The phone is out of order for a week and will be for close to a month. Terrible Customer Service from Sony. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am writing this review after using the phone for two weeks. I switched to Xperia 10 plus from Xperia XZs and Z3 before that. I used to be a fan of the Sony brand with much all my electronics being Sony (2 TVs, a receiver, a radio, a BT speaker, BT headphones, and cellphones). However, recently I am mostly disappointed in the design, features, and quality Sony offers at a premuim price. On the positive side 1. Sony Xperia 10 plus phone seems to have better connection on TMobile than both XZs and Z3 before it. 2. It has a better camera, but still not too good, which always surprised me with Z3 and XZs how crappy Sony phone cameras are, considering that Sony makes phone photo sensors. 3. It FINALLY has a functioning fingerprint reader. 4. The screen image is very good. However, in my opinion, there are several deficiencies that would prevent me from recommending this model. 1. It arrived in an open box. Just like several others have complained. 2. The phone is not loud enough even at Max volume. When I am outside, it is hard to hear the caller. The volume is OK over bluetooth in the car. However, i noticed that during the call the usefull volume adjustment is very limited; it is useful at just the max and a notch below, and anything lower is inaudible. 3. The fingerprint reader is finicky, working most of the times but not always. I added 2 versions of my right thumb prints and it still manages to not recognize. For comparison, my son's Galaxy s10e sensor works always and very quickly. 4. The power button and the fingerprint sensor are separate. On Z3 and XZs power button and fingerprint sensor (although not enabled) were one thing. By force of habit and ergonomically my thumb finds the fingerprint sensor, so I find myself pressing on the sensor when I am trying to lock the phone. This is a poor engineering decision. 5. Long screen is a con for me rather than the pro. I understand it is designed to match movie format, but I do not watch many movies on such small screen, so black bars during the movie were never a concern for me. However, put my phone in my front pocket, and it is uncomfortable to sit down or bend down with this phone in my pocket as its corners dig into my stomach. Additionally, randomly the home screen gets resized to the more mainstream format. In other words, on the home screen I have icons at the bottom of the screen and, a few times, after I unlocked the phone, these icons were pushed two rows up. Furthermore, when mirroring screen to a TV to view pictures (when unable to Cast like with a Samsung TV) the long screen wastes a lot of space at the top and the bottom making the actual image I am trying to see tiny. 6. I had issues with the screen rotation. Even though rotation was turned on, the screen would get stuck in either a portrait or landscape and a reboot would be requred to fix. I tested accelerometer per instructions on Sony website and it tested OK. I wonder if this is another quirk of the long screen. 7. Cameras on the back protrude out of the body of the phone and give this thin phone extra thickness, but more importantly without a case they are susceptible to damage when the phone is laid down on a desk, because it is either screen down or camera down. 8. Pictures are OK but can't compare to those taken with my wife's iPhone or with my son's Galaxy S10e. I understand that those are higher level models, but if history holds true, in a year we will see S10e clearing for about what this phone costs today. Overall, in my opinion, this phone sells at a premium price, has a form factor which I don't find convenient and has quirks caused by the screen, has power button separate from the fingerprint sensor, and has poor outdoors calls volume, broke within 2 months. I am looking forward to changing to another device and would not recomment these long Sony phones to anyone.",

            "body": "Overall this is a good quality mid-priced phone. The screen is nice, the fingerprint scanner works well, the build is solid. I have premium phones that take a better picture, but the cameras on this are fine for this price point. The 2x optical zoom is very nice, and by the way that works with video too. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of field -- I shot some video through a window out to the back yard, and you could see the fibers on the window screen two feet away as well as the trees much farther out. Performance specs (RAM, CPU) are plenty good enough for most uses (although gamers can find beefier CPUs), and operations is smooth. The Android experience seems to be relatively standard, other than a folder of Sony apps and their \"side sense\" feature, which I like. The thing that's most different about this phone is how long and skinny it is. It's more pronounced than I had imagined, having used another fairly long smartphone. This one is both narrower and taller than what I am used to, and it changes the way I use the phone. With this phone I find myself wanting to split the screen and have two apps running; fortunately with Android N, and the large RAM, that's a pretty smooth experience. I do wish, though, that I could, for example, give 60% of the screen to YouTube and 40% to Settings, and watch them side by side. That doesn't seem to be possible. So think about your use case. My guess is that the folks who will like this phone the most will be those who find the split-screen feature useful but don't want to pay the currently *insane* prices for a folding phone.",

She wasn't receiving my texts 100% of the time. And she couldn't even check her emails. I wasn't the only one who was having problems reaching her. My mother, her brothers, and others were all getting increasingly frustrated. You can curse the darkness or light a candle. I decided to light a candle. This phone comes unlocked which means that it didn't matter that she had her own plan, different from mine. And this is a great phone. She was a loyal Samsung user but I decided to take a chance on Sony. I figured she would like it well enough. I was not prepared for how enthusiastic she would be. First, the phone was super easy for her to set up. We picked up a screensaver for her because, to be fair, she's pretty hard on her phones. I insisted that she call or text me before she communicated with anyone else. And she did. Second, a day later, she sent me a selfie. She loves the camera. The quality of the pictures is so good, she's been updating her social media more frequently. Third, she was able to add an SD card. Because she takes art commissions based on the pictures she posts on social media, she needs to take a lot of pictures. Having a phone that can be easily upgraded is an essential (and, I confess, I didn't even think about this as an essential feature for her.) Overall, we all hear from her more often--whether it is via text or phone call. She was able to sync up her email with the phone. Her experience has been great and I have no complaints because she is not the type to settle for something that isn't good enough, even if new is better than old. Glad she likes this new phone even more than I had hoped she would.",

            "body": "When it comes to smartphones, Apple iPhone & Samsung Galaxy dominate the market. However, you still have other brands with their own devices that are still attempting to compete with their own line (Sony, Motorola, LG, etc.). This Sony Xperia 10 Plus is a sleek phone with a lot of great features. The size is HUGE! The screen is true 16:9 ratio, so movies and shows filmed in their format naturally fill up the entire screen with no black bars. It truly is amazing! A downside is the sound speaker. It's very poor quality and actually had cackles and static when playing music and sound effects from games. The battery life is amazing! I use it to play games and as a backup device so I can get a couple of days, depending on how frequently I use it, before charging. If I go out and play Pokemon Go for a community day, it'll last the entire event. When playing games, sometimes there is some lag or choppiness, that I don't typically see on my iPhone X. This is my first Android device, so learning how to use it takes some time. I'm still trying to learn how to take screenshots, turn up my brightness, etc. However I really like some of the differences in regards to multi-tasking and background app features that iPhone doesn't have. There are also two rear cameras which takes great quality portrait style photographs. There are a lot of fun things you can do with the camera also, like AR features and filters. It's a great phone option that works great, has many great features, and doesn't cost nearly as much as the leading brands. A great choice.",

            "body": "This is an interesting phone, but only because of its 21:9 screen shape. Otherwise it is unremarkable. The phone is very slippery. It feels solid though...with the exception of the sim card tray. The sim card tray is the flimsiest I have ever seen. It looks like it could break easily. One good thing about the sim card tray is that you don\u2019t need to use a sim card tray removal tool. There\u2019s a fingernail tab instead. There is some bloatware during setup, but luckily you are allowed to unselect it. Battery life seems ok. The first days it seemed to drain faster than I expected. It seemed to be ok after a day or two. This is probably more perception than anything else. The screen is the only thing to really pay attention to about this phone, and it is a mixed bag of good and bad. The screen is just ok. I am used to a higher resolution screen at this point. Sometimes text looks fuzzy and blurry. The larger top bezel and small bottom bezel are surprisingly not an issue. It got used to it immediately, but originally thought the lack of symmetry would bother me. The height of this phone is only slightly larger than my iPhone 7 Plus. If you are used to a phone of that size, you will have no issue. Movies at the correct aspect ratio, and even stretched Youtube videos look great when they fill the entire screen. It is very nice to use all of the screen real estate for once. Generally, this phone feels slow at times. Inertial scrolling is weird and jerky, with lag. On Geekbench, it scored 1351 Single Core, and 4929 Multi-Core. Perhaps the most annoying thing about this phone is how incredibly slow the ambient light sensor reacts to changes in brightness. Sometimes I pull the phone out of my pocket and the screen is on, and it takes thirty seconds for the screen brightness to come up tot he level where it needs to be. There is a higher-end model, the Xperia 1 (not yet released as of April 2019), with this same screen size. Although I have not tried that model, I expect it to fix all of the issues I mentioned in this review. It has more ram, a top of the line processor, and even has Eye Auto Focus!",

The colors are beautiful, and one other important thing..... the sound of my YouTube music is wonderful. Soon, I will venture into it more, but meanwhile, it is my first and I love it!",

Performance was the same as every other Android phone I've used from BLU, Motorola and others, nothing special like I was hoping. Apps performed the same, websites performed the same, no WOW factor here. Overall, not a bad phone, and a very good camera, but not worth it with all these shortcomings IMHO.

The rest of the time, image quality varies greatly, and feels underwhelming mostly. - Panoramic images aren't very well processed (clearly shows the stitching points). - Low light camera is great - when using a tripod. I have yet to find it helpful when photographing people, let alone moving ones. Bottom line I was really disappointed from the so called camera-phone king.

            "body": "I ended up returning this phone same day it arrived via UPS due to the fact that after setting it up and getting things rolling with my carrier, I could barely hear the ringtone and alerts even at max volume (phone had latest updates and was not in a case). Attempted to see if videos and what not had the same issue, and while I could hear them a little better, they sounded tinny and again max volume did not help much (but it was better than the ringtones at the very least). Not sure how long the battery lasts since I never had it long enough to test that. It's sad that this is apparently an issue that has plagued the Pixel 3 since it was released in 2018, and it is a deal breaker for me (I wish I had known ahead of time this was a problem, I would never have gotten the phone to begin with). Pros: - Setup was a breeze, and I liked the fact you could transfer all of your data/apps/etc from your old phone to the new one - Takes really nice photos Cons: - CAN NOT HEAR THE RINGTONE OR ALERTS EVEN ON MAX VOLUME (I'm sure if you put it in a case the issue would be even WORSE)",

            "body": "I bought this phone NEW from Amazon, set it up and used it for 2 days. Charged it 2 times totally and it was working perfectly. When i charged the 3rd time and tried to open the phone screen i noticed the phone was completely DEAD. Performed diagnostics by pressing power + volume button myself and by the google tech followed by local Google service center (UBreakIFix) and they told me the mother board has issues. Unfortunately, i opened and started using the phone after 45 days from receiving the phone so Amazon would not take it back as it was outside return window. Google said they will send me a replacement in 5 to 10 days a \"REFURBISHED\" phone in exchange for my 2 day old bricked NEW phone. Google warranty service is very poorly run and clueless about warranty issues and i had to talk to 5 reps including a supervisor(who called me back after 3 days) to straighten things out. Keeping fingers crossed until i receive my replacement phone and hope that does not have issues. Moral: I am not sure i will ever trust a device manufacturer \"Google\" whose device died in 2 days and never wait to open any device and put it through test before the return window.",

            "body": "Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser. \u00a0I purchased a Pixel 3 XL earlier this year and have had no significant issues aside from some speaker noise. Since I was happy with the phone, I decided to purchase a Pixel 3 to replace an out-dated Android phone that a relative was using. The phone got here quickly and looked to be in perfect condition. However, when I started setting it up, I noticed there were many problems. It turns out that none of the major sensors are working! The phone doesn't rotate when viewing videos, typing, taking pictures, etc. regardless of whether or not the auto-rotate feature is on. Moreover, the active edge (when you squeeze the phone) did not work at all no matter how much (or little) I squeezed. The \"lift to check\" and \"double tap to wake\" features also didn't work. Finally, the proximity sensor did not work during calls and the ambient light sensor failed to register differences in brightness. Overall I'm really disappointed because apparently this is a well known and documented issue, yet it still hasn't been resolved! I wish I would have read more about the Pixel 3 and it's issues instead of just blindly relying on my experience with the Pixel 3 XL.",

Returning the phone was painless, Amazon sent another out promptly. Driving to a UPS store sucks as does packing it up, oh well. Every call I've had with this second phone is terrible, terrible reception, some calls dropped, constantly having to repeat myself. I researched and found both the microphone and poor call quality is an issue with this phone.

            "body": "I purchased this phone with great anticipation. I like the size (I have the Pixel 3), the camera is fantastic, and the user interface is, for the most part, excellent. The problem? It is a dud of a telephone. I make several calls a day and have found myself starting every call with, \"can you hear me?\" About 40% of the people who receive calls from me can not hear me, or hear a garbled voice, or nothing at all. This is not a reception issue, as I initially thought. Search \"poor call quality on Pixel 3\" and you will find numerous posts and discussions concerning this issue. Hundreds of complaints from all over the world to be found detailing the exact issue that I have. Google seems to be ignoring the problem. I have called for help and am walked through a series of steps that do solve the issue, for a day or half a day, or for a couple of calls. I don't have time to open settings, then apps, then find the phone app, then clear the cache, etc. before every call. Do not purchase this phone until you search \"call quality on Pixel 3\". One final note for audiophiles: sound quality on headphones is weak, muffled, and has an overall cheap sound. When I want to stream music using a phone and headphones, I use an old HTC with Beats Audio. The Pixel 3 does not even come close to the sound quality.",

A year of dealing with buggy hotspot and stupidity like an update that made the phone think it was roaming all of the time were tolerable but 4 days after my 1 yr was up, the bottom speaker went out. So now I have no speakerphone, alarm, and the phone won\u2019t even ring. The only way to get google support is through email or an app on the phone. They say they will take care of it as a 1 time courtesy. 3 weeks later I\u2019m writing this review on an iPhone 11 Pro as after multiple e-mails I still have a broken pixel 3. Apparently the bad speaker is a common problem there is a massive reddit thread about it. Such an awful experience I switched to Apple.",

And his phone did crack about a month ago, he called Google for a replacement, and they responded he cannot get a replacement until they resolve an issue, which apparently is because they forgot to update the serial number for the insurance from the first *defective* phone to the second phone that he received. He called at least five times more since then, and so far everytime he gets connected to somebody the response has been \"we will look into this and get back to you\" and NEVER getting back to him. Now his phone is not only cracked but also super slow, taking at least 30 seconds before camera loads, randomly turning itself off and rebooting, not loading a new browser for 2 minutes at times, etc. AND THEY DONT HAVE A PHYSICAL STORE SO WE CANT EVEN GO ANYWHERE AND COMPLAIN IN PERSON.

Cons: *Less ram *Smaller screen compared to other models. *No telephoto lens, but seems to make up for it using Google technology. *Display quality not as good as other brands, but I cannot really tell difference.",

My work phone is an iPhone 7, and even as dumb down as iPhones are, I still find the Pixel 3 to be more intuitive. With the Pixel 3, I have far less issues unlocking the home screen, or connecting anything to Bluetooth. Overall, it's better than the iPhone, it takes better pictures, and even uploads full resolution to the cloud (whatever the hell that means). So, even the 64gb version is more than enough, unless you're 70+ yrs old, and don't know what that means. If you're deciding between iPhone or Pixel, go with the Pixel. Unless you already went with the iPhone previously, then stick with that, so you don't annoy your kid-in-laws with questions about the cloud.",

            "body": "If you are in the market for a phone, I suggest you avoid the Google Pixel 3. My old phone got wet and I went to the phone kiosk in Costco to get a replacement. I remarked on the fairly high cost of the 10e and the salesman suggested the Pixel 3 as an alternative. It was about $300 less than the 10e so I decided to try it. (There is a 90-day return policy when you purchase a phone through Costco.) The phone has a lot of nice features but the deal breaker for me was the sound, or rather the lack of it. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it was nearly impossible to hear the audio (I was trying to listen to a podcast at the gym) anywhere but in a virtually silent environment. Also, incredibly, Google decided not to include a headphone jack but instead to provide a dongle (!!) for connecting headphones via the charging port. Aside from the fact that this is an archaic and clunky implementation, it also tends to stress the charging port. So, an otherwise pretty decent phone is not worth getting, at least in my view. Surprising badly implemented technology from Google. It all worked out for me in the end because I traded it in after two days and got the Samsung 10e instead.",

I still love that phone and it satisfies all my needs except feeling that I was tethered to a charger. I have no complaints because after 2-1/2 yrs it owed me nothing. So I decided to upgrade to the Z3 since the price was so reasonable. Now admittedly I am totally thrilled with the new functionality of the Z3 - except for the battery life. It does not retain a charge any longer than my Z Play. In fact, I am wondering if this is a reconditioned phone in which they did not change the battery. My next call is customer service but I wanted to forewarn others in case they experienced the same issues.",

My previous phone was an LG Aristo that I paid $100 for from my local AT&T store, and I'm getting a better signal from the A50. It's quick, beautiful, and the camera is great! I'm not a heavy gamer, just a few puzzle games here and there if I'm stuck somewhere with nothing to do, so I can't speak on it's prowess as a gaming device. If I'm going to play a heavy game, I'm going to use my computer, not a phone. I refuse to pay high dollar for a flagship phone, this is a wonderful device at a good price.",

            "body": "The Samsung Galaxy A50 is a decent phone, and almost all of the functions work. But not quite as advertised. I am not nearly as pleased with it, and it's performance, as I had hoped I would be. When researching the problems I found no other a 50 owners experiencing the same. Makes me wonder if this phone was dropped or mishandled before it was shipped. Also, the 64 GB class 3 MicroSD card that came with the phone does not work and never has. In this phone or any other device I have tried it in. A clear phone cover came with the phone, and it is extremely flimsy. I fear it would offer nearly no protection. I also got a three-month plan from mint mobile with the phone. Went ahead and activated it, and it is the absolute worst service I have ever had. Weather sitting in my home or outside, or even a large city, I rarely get more than two bars for a signal. Any kind of streaming or mobile gaming is pretty much out of the question.",

(NOTE: Will not work on Verizon network. I activated mine on AT&T without a problem.) All in all, it's a good phone, BUT the on-screen fingerprint scanner is garbage. It doesn't work even half the time. When it works, it's like winning a lottery. So if this feature is important to you, then you may want to consider getting a phone with a physical fingerprint reader. Fortunately, the phone comes with many different authentication options, but I really wish that the fingerprint scanner works more consistently. (Yes, I applied the update from Samsung in Nov 2019 - it did not help.)",
